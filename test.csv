1,"I liked this book overall, though I spent most of it annoyed that Antonia was arguing and fighting with people at every second over every little thing. It was very frustrating but I did like the ending.",Review
2,"Since other reviewers gave info about the plot, I will just stick to my impressions about the read.  This was a free book on Kindle which is a prequel to a series which I have not read.  This story was a very quick read, and the main characters were not especially engaging to me.  I liked the premise of the story with the spirit animal guides, and the special abilities which they conferred on the characters.  While I found this book to be somewhat entertaining, I haven't decided yet if I like the writing well enough to purchase the next book in the series.",Quick and easy read
3,"I love, love, love Kiera and Gabriel's story! It had a lot of action, suspense, and wicked romance!! I am really getting into these characters and their lives and enjoy hearing their stories. If you like a little bit of it all, werewolves, vampires and fairies, this book has it all!. If you get a chance start reading this series, it is a little slow at first, but with each book the author makes them all come more alive. Looking forward to the stories of some of the new werewolves that have entered into this series. Great job!!",WOW!
4,"This was a good twist, on a already great story. I was glaf that everyone ended up happy in the end. I could not put it done!",OMG... So good!
5,These stories put into perspectivewhat most do not know about the war and the hatred against Jews. It disgusted me what so many people went though. Sad. It was also amazing ho may partisan groups fought back like they did. The truly had courage.,Truly remarkable.
6,This book is witty and fun from the first page to the last. I highly recommend it. I'm looking forward to more from this author.  And there is a sequel.,"Finally, a funny sci-fi book"
7,"This book was okay. If it wasnt free, then I wouldnt download it. It wasnt bad for free but if you have to pay, pass on it. The book dragged out for too long.",Okay ...
8,"This review is a bit contradictory because what I loved about this story, made it quite lacking at well.*SPOILERS*The excerpt does a good job describing the story and how the hero (Xenos) was throughout the book, I loved that he was an alien crossbreed who looked and behaved like it. So many times, I've read the 'lazy- I-don't-want-make-my-audience-uncomfortable-version' of sci-fi romances where the only things alien about the characters are their names and customs!nLike the excerpt states, Xenos is jaded and hardened emotionally and I like that the author remained true to that definition of who he was. He grew up in a lab where he was tortured, experimented on, and reared where he never had any positive emotional contact with anyone. And, because of how he looked, he was always on guard with everyone. Moonlight entered the picture, offering him her body for her mother's freedom, but she was disgusted and revolted by who he was and how he looked. Sure, her body responded to him sexually even though she hated, but he knew how she felt, so beyond the physical demands of his body, his overwhelming purpose was tied to his mission to defy his leaders and to stop the breeding and testing in the labs. So building on the sexual desire, Moonlight became interested in the Xenos the person. Now some readers might see her interest as being one-sided as she made most of the overtures in the relationship, but while I do get that sometimes as readers we want to see reciprocity to 'even' a relationship, in this case I understood why it couldn't be so. To accept the relationship, you had to remember who Xenos was, how he grew up and the events that shaped his life. He never knew love, tenderness,acceptance, or even a relationship and he also was insecure therefore all approaches had to come from Moonlight. Moonlight was strong in that she didn't need the scorecard. I thought that she took responsibility for the fact that SHE wanted him and in her internal dialogue, we see she accepted the challenges and came with being with someone who was so closed off.That being said, I think the author missed the mark with Moonlight's overall development. I didn't feel like I knew enough about her and it made her character a tad bit underwhelming.The story also focused too much on the rebellion/mission and even though Xenos and Moonlight's relationship was developing, it was merely based on their sexual compatibility. Every time they came together, it was about sex. This is my contradictory peeve, because while I like how focused the author was on maintaining Xenos character, the story ultimately is a romance, and there could've been a little more on the romance side without necessarily jeopardizing the storyline. Also, the sex scenes were very repetitive...in fact, after the first one, every other scene felt like it was cut and pasted with just a word change here and there. Xenos basically did the same things, Moonlight gasped the same words over and over!!There are a few graphic elements that a potential reader should be aware of. It's not too crazy or overly descriptive, but it is there.Finally, the end of the book left much to be desired. I felt like the author was detached from the romance side and it showed through in the end. Nevertheless, its a book that I recommend!","3.5 stars for a good story, but left me wanting!"
9,"It doesn't matter that she looks as if she stepped off the pages of Penthouse; Hailey Jennison is socially inept when it comes to dealing with men. Currently her only glimpse of sex is the Friday night peep show her and her friends partake in. A construction worker across from her friend's apartment could put a Greek God to shame with all the muscles that adorn his body. Gage knows that the source of all his wet dreams for the past six months is part of the female group who ogle him every Friday night as he prances around in the nude. Deciding to take a chance he finds himself blackmailing the blond bombshell into a dinner date. Now all he has to do it keep his mouth from ruining the best shot he's ever had at love and lust combined.All you need on a blistering cold day is a hot cup of chocolate and a steaming hot book to cuddle up with. Enjoying the Show provides the steam with whipped cream on top. A total chick book with its quirky comedic parts: a group of women who put the ladies from Sex in the City to shame and a man even a grandmother would drool over. I found myself with an uncontrollable grin as I read how two beautiful people with less than stellar social graces came together for one fiery encounter after another. Marie Harte did an excellent job creating two characters, Gage and Hailey, you couldn't help but love as you laughed at their growing relationship. The added plus for this book is Gage's family; if only we all could grow up with such an eclectic and open mix.Indyreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Enjoying the Show
10,"I got both this and the first two stories in this series at the same time and I have to say I devoured them all in much less than two days. I loved the world Moira Rogers's created and I couldn't help wanting more and more of it!The modern world and society are hell on werewolf traditions and the packs living in big cities have been corrupted into something more akin to a dictatorship.Red Rock is home of one of the few packs in the world where the old laws and traditions are still appreciated and is also considered sanctuary to those who need to escape the cruel life among the distorted packs.In Sanctuary's Price we get to se the love story between the werewolf Dylan and the witch Sasha. A Romeo & Juliet sort of story, since werewolves and witches have been at war for centuries and the prejudice against each other runs quite deep.I love me some Alpha males, that is no secret, but what I really loved about this story was that Dylan wasn't really an Alpha male, he is more on the fringe of the pack's dynamic and even considered a weaker wolf. It was great to see that just because he isn't an Alpha, is doesn't mean he isn't strong and able to defend those he love and care about.Sasha is terrified, all the time, ever since her mentor was killed and she has had to hide amongst the werewolves, most of which hate her for being a witch. Just like Dylan, I loved seeing her prove to be much more than what people's perception of her.Dylan and Sasha are so perfect for each other and it's impossible not to pull for them from page one. I also love that even though the romance was definitely at the forefront of the novel, there was so much more going on plot wise, that you couldn't help but getting engaged in the action and the stakes in play.Ever since I read Moira Rogers's South Arcana series I've been a fan, The Red Rock Pass series just cements my love for this great duo of authors. Rogers is an automatic buy for me now! If you love PNR just as much as I do, check out this series!Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}",Great!
11,"Some of the jokes were pathetic, some funny and many repeated through the book. Glad I got it for free.",Eh...
12,"I honestly don&#8217;t know what this book was about. Great title, but what Old Town? I still don&#8217;t know. Is it Glasgow, London, Manchester, a little fishing village in Scotland, I don&#8217;t know.So many of the stories failed to reach an ending or make any sense whatsoever. You&#8217;ve got one guy who starts the story by getting a right spanking off a few blokes, but we never find out why or what led up to it. He ends up beating a drug dealer up, tying his hands and feet together and then placing his feet through a pair of gymnast&#8217;s rings! How does he manage that when they&#8217;re tied together? And even if he untied them what would keep them there? He&#8217;d just drop to the floor.We get another fellow who&#8217;s the butt of a joke at a roof party &#8211; I&#8217;m trying desperately not to be a &#8216;spoiler&#8217; here &#8211; with the words, &#8220;Should have known who&#8217;d been holding the it an&#8217; all&#8230;&#8221; and I&#8217;ve no idea what that means. Anyway he takes the opportunity to attack two of his antagonists from behind and push them off the roof stating, &#8220;I held onto their belts for a moment until I had to let go.&#8221; WHAT! He held onto their belts for a moment? Assuming they weighed approximately the same as him, he&#8217;s holding twice his own weight with no anchorage whatsoever. It would pull him straight off the roof too.This is another story that just stops. A crowded party, everyone would have either witnessed him do this or seen the bodies falling through the air and looked round at him. But no, the story just stops right there. It&#8217;s rubbish!Too often we&#8217;re left to guess at the ending. Two young boys playing on a beach hear a choir, a sure sign that there&#8217;s been loss of life at sea, and then their mother doesn&#8217;t turn up for tea. Are we supposed to assume she&#8217;s dead? She certainly wasn&#8217;t lost at sea. I didn&#8217;t know what to make of that story at all.Then there&#8217;s the story of three white lads attacking and raping Muslim women. It seemed to jump about all over the place, going back in time and introducing (I think) six Muslim men that I kind of lost track as to who was who.Nigel Bird seems a genuine chap, who&#8217;s very serious about his writing, and I feel awful offering such a poor review, especially as he&#8217;s evidently working so hard, but I have to be honest. I think his writing is actually quite good but his plots are rubbish. They have little more imagination than an average schoolboy. They start out of nowhere, in the middle of a plot, and finish abruptly when the reader knows full well there&#8217;s going to be consequences for the actions taken at the end.Every story is incomplete. I won&#8217;t be reading anymore from this author.",What a load of old tosh!

14,"I expect more from a book from the publisher, Ellora's Cave.  I would not call this a book, as it only has 66 pages.  It is not a novel, but a novella.  I enjoyed it.  Gargoyle is a good strong hero choice.  I liked the main characters.  I would have liked more adventure.  It seemed like it was going there but then the 'chase' was over.  I would have liked more from the 'bad guy'.  A flashback, or extended backstory, of how the curse was laid on Cray would have helped immensely.",nice premise

16,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author, whoever it was, captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action, but not a bad little love story.",Not Really About U-Boats
17,"A cowboy, Christian Mystic struggles to survive the double curse that a family of evil sorcerers have placed upon his family while he is also struggling to save his ranch and  hind a place in his life for the girl that he loves in spite of all common sense.The writer uses alternating first person voice, and the feminine persona rings slightly off key.  Strangely enough many passages of the book have a very feminine poetic quality.  The author's plot resolution is one of the best and most unusual examples of the incorporation of Christian Mysticism, and redeems the stilted dialogue.",Many Waters by  William Woodall

19,"A great collection of short stories ranging from locked-room mysteries to horrors to parody and satyre :) That being my first &#34;meeting&#34; with J. A. Konrath I have to say I can't wait to read any of his full-length novels.I am not a fan of short stories (I kind of get attached to the main characters in a novel and hate to part with them too quckly) and definitely not a fan of horrors (my imagination being too vivd, obviously:)), but nonetheless I found all the stories in &#34;65 Proof&#34; at least intriguing, and most of them really amusing. I loved the twists and the humour, although I probably sometimes missed on the cultural/local puns - as I am not a native-speaker of English, which has not in the least taken any joy and fun from the reading:DDefinitely a must for anyone who likes intelligent, somewhat crazy and funny story-telling:D","Definitely a must for anyone who likes intelligent, somewhat crazy and funny story-telling:D"

22,"Like another reviewer I came across this book whilst searching for Haruki Murakami. No luck buying Kindled Murakamai in Australia so I decided to give this new writer a go- the price was reasonable enough.There are some Murakami-esque elements to the novella, slightly surreal plot and characters who are somewhat removed from everyday life. There is a certain clunkiness to the writing and the narrator's introspection can be somewhat annoying. I think the weaknesses are just first-timer issues that will improve with experience and a good editor.The Kindle versio has some justification issues when there is dialogue and someone has been careless with Spellcheck as there are a few typos that tend to be homophones, eg ""suite yourself"" and ""this will due"".

24,"I was born not long after the end of World War II.  Some of my earliest memories are of hiding under the table out on my Grandma's porch listening to my Dad and all of my uncles talk about their experiences during the war.  World War II, and in particular the Holocaust, has always held a fascination (for want of a better word) for me. I've read countless books on the subject, watched dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours of movies and documentaries, and even had a chance to see & hear about some of what happened first hand both here at home and living in Germany.In general, I do not approve of fiction when it comes to the Holocaust.  Let me tell you why.  This is an event that must never be forgotten, an event that some (all too many) deny ever happened, even with many survivors and combatants on both sides still alive. So, when I hear about something like ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", first presented as a real event, then later declared to be a complete fiction by the authors themselves, I cringe.  It will not be long before all of the direct witnesses have passed.  Even my generation, the ones who heard the stories first hand, who saw the tattoos, who have walked the remnants of the battlegrounds, are getting on up there. Before too long, there will be nothing to witness except words written in a book.  Those words must be truth, not fantasy.  Otherwise, in 25 or 30 or 40 years people can simply point to a stack of made up books and say ""see - all fiction - never happened.""There are some cases, though, where a story is important to tell even if it must be told through the medium of fiction because there are no longer living witnesses - or perhaps never were.  One of those stories is the roundup,subsequent abandonment and final shipment to Auschwitz of more than 4,000 children in the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris, an action carried out by the French police on Petain's orders.  There were few survivors - a mere handful - and most of those were young children at the time.  Tatiana de Rosney does an excellent job of telling the story of this horrific event inSarah's Key.Until very recently even the fact that there WERE Jewish partisans was not particularly well known, at least not in popular mediums.  Leon Uris talks about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising inExodus.  Rudi Weiss joins the Jewish partisans inHolocaust.  Only in the last few years has the story of the Bielski Brothers -The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 JewsandDefiance- truly documented the Jewish Resistance.  As heroic as the Bielskis were, their group was not the only Jewish resistance group. It is vitally important that a couple of decades from now, when all who were there to witness or spoke to those who witnessed are gone, that people know that everyone did not march quietly to the slaughter like so many sheep, that the Bielskis were neither alone in their resistance nor an aberration. There is room in the historical record forThe Remnant - Stories of the Jewish Resistance in WWII.Othniel Seiden's story has its foundations in a great deal of research - interviews, records of the Nuremberg proceedings, diaries left behind by those who lived these events - and he has done a remarkable job of presenting characters that are accurate & compelling composites.Some have commented negatively on his portrayal of the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Hitler's Final Solution, particularly as regards the Pope in office at the time of World War II, a role that has been the subject of great debate over the years, debate that is not yet entirely settled.  The basic facts that Seiden addresses in this regard - that the Catholic Church had a pact with Hitler and that the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape Europe at the end of World War II - are grounded in known, demonstrable facts.  It is only since the papacy of Pope John Paul II, himself a Polish seminary student during World War II, that there has been some attempt to rehabilitate the reputation of Pope Pius XII regarding his actions towards the Nazis and the ""Final Solution."" Had Seiden chosen to present this rehabilitative material, information that would have been unknown to the characters at the time during which these events occurred, would be to rewrite history.  That would be a grave error.Highly recommended.  This is worth your time to read.",Worth your time to read!
25,"I read this because the author claims story is like some my favorite authors(Lara Adrian, J R Ward, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Gena Showalter) BULL!I started out liking this book then it turned out to be one disaster after another. Starting with being named Prophesy, because she is the daughter of the prophesy, (true imagination there) falling in love with the vampire that kidnaps her, Valentine, having to deal with 1000 year old vampire librarian, frozen witches, all the way to destroying half the vampire army that was coming to assisted her with werewolf allies and flooding the one she loves. Oh not to mention its actually a cliff hanger.The star rating wend down the further I read. the rating went further down when read the reviews on her next books.

26,I enjoyed this book. The pace keep the action moving and the plot kept me interested. I appreciated the way that it treated the mid-eastern characters with respect.,Engaging
27,"Identical twin sisters Gwendolyn and Anora are complete opposites, but fierce friends nonetheless. Gwendolyn is the tomboy of the duo - even going so far as to cut her hair short and wear men's clothing, while Anora exudes a very feminine nature. As the eldest by minutes, Anora has been placed in an arranged marriage, but thankfully, it turned out to be a love match anyways. The night before her wedding, the two sneak out unchaperoned for one last sisterly moment of bonding, when the unthinkable happens and they are kidnapped by two wandering Vikings. They believe Gwendolyn to be male (in men's clothing and short hair) and take the duo back to their ship in repair, even though it is expressly forbidden by the captain, Hakon. From here on out, the story is about Hakon and his interaction with the 'brother' Garric and sister Anora. Gwendolyn continues her identity as Garric in hopes to keep Anora's virtue intact for her betrothed.Well, the one thing that attracted me to the story was the outline. As most of these stories go, I thought I could have predicted what happened, but unfortunately, I think my assumption was probably a better story than this. I found the story to be trite, shallow, messy, and incredibly misogynistic. I know well that most romance stories have a bit of misogyny in them, but this one was pretty thick with it.Let me start with the storytelling. It's messy in that it is constantly vacillating point of views. One paragraph is through Gwendolyn's eyes, the next is Hakon, and then the next one is some chambermaid in the same room giving her $0.02. So it goes on. It took me many chapters to get used to it. And yes, I did read the whole thing (mainly in hopes to see a redeeming quality in the couple).And the descriptions, whoa. Adverbs stacked on adjectives stacked on adverbs. I like description, but most of it felt forced or trite, as if there was a book of synonyms on the ready for *every* sentence.Also, the beginning of the story held a lot of completely unnecessary crap. If the story is not going to be about Wulfgar and Anora, maybe one should stop writing such intricate details about their history and the political notions of it all. When it doesn't last past the first few chapters, never to be touched upon again, I feel like my time is wasted with pointless words completely lacking in entertainment or reason.The twins' ruse was poorly written. I believe another reviewer noticed the same. How can the both be so incredibly fair and beautiful and gorgeous and gifts of the gods when one can be so easily mistaken for a young boy? I absolutely hated Hakon as a character, but it was laughable to read the spew of compliments he would bestow upon Anora, then hate so easily on Garric without any inkling of her identity, then praise Gwendolyn (as Anora) exactly the same - never the wiser! Yet every chapter some background character made a comment on how absolutely magnificent and awe-inspiring was the beauty of either...but only if they were in a dress. /eyeroll/ Put some pants on a girl and she's too mannish to believed to be a girl. Riiiiight.Now to the 'romance' of Gwendolyn and Hakon. Not once did I feel any genuine love between the two. For chapters, Hakon praises his affections and lust for Anora, from the very beginning. When they are first discovered on the ship, the reader anticipates a kind captain with morals, but instead the reader gets an arrogant warrior who's okay with raping and taking some hostages as slaves. While I get his reasons for not turning around and dropping the twins back off at England, did he really have to enforce slavery? Not only slavery, but insist on getting Anora to bed him as some kind of sex slave (incredibly confidently, I might add). I get that this was probably exactly the kind of man one would expect in this era, but it's not very attractive to read about in a romance novel. So not only is he constantly forcing his affections on an incredibly frightened Anora and just scaring the bejeezus out of her with his talks of forcing himself upon her, but he doesn't even get a whiff of difference when Anora and Gwendolyn change places. Absolutely nothing is amiss to him. The first night Hakon and Gwendolyn (as Anora) are together...it's just very...rape-y. He does force himself...but it's some kind of weird thing that Gwendolyn (all this time has completely hated and disgusted by this guy) just turns over like a cat in heat all of a sudden. I think, as a reader, one is supposed to just accept that her body knows what's best for her heart...or something like that? Even through the realization of love and all that, Hakon never knows who's who. I mean, I would think true love should at least be able to see a person past their indescribably beautiful body to fall in love with someone and then fall in love with an identical someone without realizing the difference. It just leaves the romance's credibility in the negative.This also applies to Gwendolyn. The reader does not come across her transition into loving him. She's wishy washy and just moody. She hates him because he took her and her sister as slaves away from her homeland! She loves him because he's great in the sack! She hates him because he's so mean to her when she's Garric. She loves him because just look at that hot, Viking body! Once she starts pretending to be Anora, all plans to escape home are just gone. Months are supposed to go by, and Anora is just sitting on her thumbs trusting her sister. I just don't get it. I don't get any precourse to love beyond lust or obligation/duty/honor above whatever it is that feels good.I mentioned the first scene of intimacy between Hakon and Gwendolyn are...rape-y. Well, the acceptance of rape was one of the biggest themes that disturbed me. It wasn't outright acceptance, per se, but it was darn close. The constant attempts to rape the twins were disheartening, but then to have the 'hero' consider it so much...yeah, not cool. One line from a background character left me doing double takes:""Whatever happened to the days when a Viking chieftain took a wench if he wanted her, and that was that! She closed her heavy-lidded eyes, a secret smile on her face, as she remembered her youth.""This particular quote in context implies that Hakon should just go ahead and rape Anora, because he's so good looking and rich and a spectacular lover, the rape will be null and void because the wench in question will love it.Yeah...this is just a horrible impression for a romance novel...and towards the 'good guy' especially.Again, I believe another reviewer also noticed the abundance of Gwendolyn's stupidity. Keep getting in trouble by walking around alone? Just keep doing it! Yeah! Not only is it a poor setup for danger, but it's also poor characterization. Need the heroine to come across the bad guy? Just write in there that she's walking around for funsies. Maybe she can not learn her lesson and do it again later...a few more times, at that.There was one line in an (albeit decent) scene of war: ""Acting on finely honed instincts..."" referring to Gwendolyn in fight. I literally laughed out loud. ""Finely honed"" indeed.A great line that's later in the book, after already been in danger numerous times:""Perhaps a walk would take her mind off the memories that continually plagued her. Aye, that was what she would do!""Such excitement for a walk!!! She must know that danger and excitement are ahead whenever she goes out alone! Good one, Gwennie!So why two stars instead of one? I read the whole thing and still hoped for a romantic redemption. I really wanted Hakon to be a decent guy. I really wanted true love to peek it's cute little head and yell, ""Surprise! I really AM here!"" If the story was just an outline, I would have enjoyed it better, because I really do like the premise. If only I had a trophy in poor execution...Lacking characters, lacking writing, overwrought descriptions, glorifying rape, zero hero/heroine presence...and thusly.Thank Odin it was free.",Shallow characters and shallow themes...

Hadn't they realized that a triad was not a conventional relationship and some people might not approve?  I would have liked it more if they had taken a little longer than just one night and morning together to comit to a relationship, but I can accept that in a short story.

35,"That is exactly what was done by the author.  She had a great story idea and then ruined it by rushing the story line, the sex scenes, the love scenes.  It would have been a wonderful story if she would have walked instead of ran through the whole thing.Take the time to describe the people and their emotions more fully.  I'm not mad I read this but I kept wanting more from it.",Rush rush rush

37,"When I first saw this cover on Facebook, I commented that I thought it was an ad for breast self examinations, and that would be a good thing. Then I somehow bought the book on Amazon and started reading it.  It made me think about all the different times and ways in which Cinderella has been presented in my life. Naked men and satyrs and pirates never really entered into it before.My first Cinderella was, no doubt, a little Golden Book Version and in 1965 I remember my mom being really excited about a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that was going to be on TV (CBS) with Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon (you know him from General Hospital). Mom was excited about it because Celeste Holm, Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon were in it. Lesley Ann Warren was a trained ballet dancer so that was going to add something. Perhaps my mother thought that would inspire me. I don't know, in ballet I always felt I had missed all the classes where we learned anything.Back then, in black and white on our thirteen-inch screen (which we had until 1972), it was magical. The music was great and I was transported. It did nothing for my career in the ballet school being taught in the fire station however.Then, in a service internship in college I interned at a state run theater and they ran Cinderella. Because it was the state we had all kinds of educational information around it. They discussed how the story was very old and they had traced it all the way to China.It certainly has had a lot of versions filmed and written throughout the years, I even saw that there is a Sin-derella from 1965. We also have the socio/psycho/anthrop-logical theories brought out of fairy tales. White knights, Peter Pan and uncomfortable shoes!What about this version of Cinderella? Queen Ella is now 31 and really horny since her Prince Charming turned into Prince Charles (ie. boring, unfaithful) and disappeared. The way she is described she reminds me of one of the Gabor sisters. She decides to hold a masquerade ball so she can find a sexual partner and incognito have sex with him.After she meets the man of her dreams at the ball but doesn't learn his name she decides to throw a second ball to find him. This time another fantasy is realized. After the second ball she realizes who her mystery lovers are. Forces, in the form of her mendacious step family in a neighboring kingdom conspire to keep them apart and bring back Prince Charming who is now a gay pirate.Will Ella and her mystery beau survive? Will Ella, Charming and his pirate lover get it on? Will Ella be cast out in disgrace? Or will they all live happily ever after?****This isn't so much a retelling as a sequel: Cinderella the Post-Charming Years.The intimate scenes are sexy even though I also found then icky. The sex wasn't terribly inventive. I had a hard time deciding if we were back in days of yore or in a post-industrial kingdom. They had a tub and bathroom with running water, but it did not seem they had cars or telephones.The book was highly predictable plot wise, although Prince Charming ending up being different than I thought he would be. It's possible I have read too many erotica books but I pretty much knew what would happen after the first 30 pages.Are there any redeeming qualities? Well Queen Ella comes off a mature,not dependent on men, and a good ruler with an egalitarian spirit. And, it isn't a retelling which was nice. The relationship between Ella and her beau is loving.I bought the Kindle version which was only $3.44. If I were to purchase a paperback I would, in all likelihood, buy something else. with the nearly $12 price tag.  Not great, not terrible. Not going to become part of my Erotica Library.","NOT YOUR MOTHER""S CINDERELLA"

45,I quit reading when I realized that this wasn't a full story in itself.  I have read series before that at least held their own story for that book and continued in others.  But I was half way through this book and quit.  I just found out the story line when I was half way through.  That doesn't bode well for the ending.  It will be a huge cliff hanger for sure and I don't go for that when reading.

She knew she had some serious decisions to make, but wanted to enjoy her family for just a little while.  Belle hadn't had a life at all.  She was working eighty hours a week with absolutely no friends or dates to take the pressure off.Belle Taylor had always had a crush on Rafe Bettencourt since she was a little girl.  They had been neighbors since before she had been born.  Even now grown up as an attorney, she felt the same tug at her heart when she was near him.  When she arrived home, her family was horrified at Belle's appearance.  She had lost a lot of weight, looked overly tired, and had the darkest circles under her eyes.  Rafe long considered family couldn't believe his eyes either.  He had stopped thinking of her as simply family since she had graduated from law school, and decided this was the time to make sure she knew she was his.  Rafe knew they had many issues to work out like the fact that they lived in two different towns, but he knew the time was right for them.Good Christmas story.  I liked both of the huge nosey overbearing families with deep connections to each other going back years.  The romance between Belle and Rafe just further cemented the bond between those families.",To Do List
49,"Right now, as I write this review, the kindle price of the book is 0.00. This annoys the living humbug out of me as I had to pay 2.99 for this thing.(ok... calming down now)This book is the reason why one must read book descriptions carefully. I originally thought that this would be about a modern girl going to the past to meet her ARTHURIAN KNIGHT. This was not the case.In the end it was basically ""Twilight"" with knights. As someone who isn't fond of Twilight you can imagine this did not sit well with me at all.I can't say that this was a terrible book. It will have it's fans. I'm just not going to be one of them. In fact, if I had known what I was getting into I wouldn't have bought it at all, and this review wouldn't exist to lower it's rating (and I mean this not in an angry way, rather as a matter of fact). So to those who will be fans of this series my apologies (again, i mean this with all sincerity and without irony.)The biggest criticism I have for this book would be that it needs a better ""Book Description"" or blurb, to help keep people like me, who haven't any interest in such things, away, and to bring in it's proper target audience.2 stars, because of personal preference against ""Twilight"" like books. It would have been a 3 if they hadn't LOWERED THE PRICE to 0.00 making me pay 2.99 for something that is now FREE!",I paid 2.99 for this?

Of course, he's hot, she's hot, and the physical attraction is explosive and enjoyable.  That will earn 3 stars in this genre.  What earned the 4th star is the quality of the characterization and the interaction between the various characters in the book.The book is a quick, short read.

In this book there is sex and more sex and the story is not present at all, at least in the first half that was all I could read.  I was hoping for more substance and that is what kept me reading.  But there was only sex for sex sakes.

It isn't until Cole sifts into a wolf while in her bed that Marion believes she might be his mate.Will she chose Cole as her mate or will Gabrielle's gentle touch and gorgeous eyes steal her heart? Can the brothers stop Stephan before he kills Marin?Jessica Coulter Smith really has outdone herself with this book. I love paranormals and recently began to like werewolf romances. The plots and scenes are beautifully written. The love that forms between Cole and Marion truly is magical. Marion starts out as a frightened, lost woman. But through her journey and finding love with Cole she becomes a strong willful, vibrant woman ready to fight for the man she loves and the life she wants.I definitely recommend this book to any paranormal romance reader. And if you haven't picked up a paranormal than I would most certainly recommend this as your first! It's captivating and spellbinding, you really feel like you are sitting through a movie as you read this book. Smith has an amazing way of expression emotion and showing detail.

66,"I bought both this book and Golden Eyes (they are related) in order to try out a new author.  I enjoy the shape shifter genre, so wanted to see if I would like her work.  Both books had potential, I thought, but I really wasn't interested in the sex - too much, too fast and certainly not traditional.  No real buildup in a relationship first - just jump into bed.  I was looking at some of her other books (she has a lot of them), but they warn of the same kind of sex, so I am probably not going there.","Well, at least they warn you..."
67,"While the male character was somewhat believable, the female character was NOT.  A thirty y/o woman who has had only 1 relationship, who has the insecurities described in the book, whose parents have died, and who spent time taking care of an ill parent may have the fantasies that Annabelle Lee has, but the way she would speak and act are completely different.  Her character would not be nearly as shallow and wanton as this female character.  Additionally, there was NO character development - these two characters ""fall madly in love"" after 2 weeks of having sex, and without any kind of acquaintance before their first introduction.  As IF!  Romance novels do have the ability to be well written with excellent plots that are bolstered by the development of the relationship between the characters.  THIS one is absolutely NOT one of them.",What a waste of time

I really enjoyed this story, it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good, but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella, but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first, book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall, I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat!

72,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I feel that the idea of the book was a good one (what would survival after a catastrophic event look like).However I felt the characters were not appropriate for the adversity and the challenging experiences that the author wanted to explore.Let me say that I felt there was a fair amount of thought put into the steps needed to have the characters survive. This was a strong plus towards making the in the book creditable, if not for the characters ages.I liked that the book took place over two and a half year time frame, giving opportunities for us (the reader) to see how the characters lives might unfold and what other issues would come up.What I did not like about the book can be narrowed down to two things.One (and this was the biggest) was that the age of the characters was simply too young to cover the issues that the author was trying to tackle, making it all seem less believable.For example our main character 'Chief' Mike. At age 13 and a half, he takes on the role of leader for the surviving teenagers. The concerns and decisions that he comes up with are far greater then what a 13 year old would come up with. Even given that he might be more 'mature' emotionally then others his age, however there is no explanation as to 'Why' he would be more mature in his understanding of life and leadership. Without this explanation, his 'judgements' and 'rules' do not sit right with reality. I am left to say, ""That's pretty wise for an early teenager, and where is his teen emotions?""I could do this same break down with the remaining characters, but you can get the idea with this one and I shouldn't go on and on about that.The next issue that I have with the book is that often the mini-crises in the story do not flow with the over all story. They seem to be cut and pasted into the storyline. It would have been more realistic to have less events play out then to have the extra mini-crises.For example the whole lodge situation, it was announced, then left until the last part of the book to be hastily played out. I felt it was poorly played out leaving me feeling flat about its resolution.So what do I think of the story and do I recommend it?I think it is worth the read, but one should have low expectations, just as you would for a 'made for T.V.' movie as opposed to a 'made for the theater' movie. If you lower your expectations you probably will enjoy this book. Because I actually did enjoy it once I finally decided just to let the 'issues' be and imagine the characters say five years older (each).Due to some of the content (rape, murder and violence) within the book, I would recommend it to readers above the age of 16.I would like to see other works by this author, as I enjoyed the storyline, and feel that maybe in time the author will improve his craft.",Surviving the Fog

The ending was so abrupt as well. When I got to the end of it, I thought there was an error while downloading! I really really wished it was longer. With such a short length, the development of the characters and story just isn't satisfactory.The characters are compelling and have a story behind them. I enjoyed how Bailey is submissive yet not a doormat, she is independent; unlike most BDSM stories where the submissive just seems so submissive, it's kinda irritating. I also love that Bailey runs a bakery and is a curvy woman, yet isn't bothered by it. As you can tell, I love Bailey!One thing I didn't like was how Aiden kept running away, and then returning, and then running away again D&#60; It gets irritating.

Jo Beverly did it magnificiently with Rothgar in Devilish, but Joely Skye is no Jo Beverley.  Trey became more ordinary as we became more intimate with him, and that was actually a bit of shame.I also had problems with the amount of waiting in this book,  the lovers were apart for far longer than they were together,  and the waiting jarred on me,  even if the Lynx could cope with it.","Love the series,  this one didn't quite work for me"

There was a scene in the middle of the book that felt inappropriate for the situation.

Great premise. The execution, however, left me wanting.I'm usually quick to accept the love at first sight thing when supernatural/other worldly forces are involved (angels/demons/vampires/werewolves/etc), but this wasn't a case of love at first sight, mating, or any other supernatural love-mojo. Yes, they were attracted to each other, but it wasn't love and he continued to insist (in his thoughts) that he didn't know why his fellow angels would fall for human women.They were only together for a day until they were bumping uglies (which isn't entirely unheard of - several people engage in overnight relationships) and ""in love"". That part was a little too difficult for me to accept, despite the angel & witch aspect.And the revenge that she wanted against her cheating jerk of an ex-boyfriend? Was just to make him jealous by going to a club and dancing provocatively with her angel. Felt a little too much like high school to me.I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters, and while I understand that this is a novella (which means word count restrictions), I didn't feel that the story was fleshed out enough. Maybe if it had been longer and the characters given more time to get to know each other (or have a supernatural force pulling them together like the werewolves' mating instinct) I might've liked it better.",Fell short

But the messages put fear into the boy while a unique cane carried by the lady from the council disquiets his mom.

A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some of that with the upcoming books.",Liked it enough to buy the next couple of books in the series...

97,"This was an interesting little short story.  I'll admit I haven't read any of the other Westervelt novels, but since this seems to be a bit of a side story, and it was available for instant download at ebookfling, I thought I would start with it.The story was actually decent.  I liked the plot.  The writing seemed a bit elementary, though.  And it could have used a good editor as well.  Also, there was no sex.  I don't even think they kissed.  There was just some vague mention of their &#34;joining&#34; after the fact.  I might have been able to overlook this if there had been any chemistry between the characters or lead-up at all.  But if this book is any indication of the others in the series I need to re-evaluate whether I am interested in picking it up.  It was more like a sci-fi story that had a little romance thrown in accidentally, but again with no chemistry or heat.",Eh.
98,"Ellen - You're now 2 for 2 on 2 Star reviews. Girlfriend, you need to double check your editor's work and keep an eye out on your reviews. I would think the error described below would be an(avoidable)embarrassment to an author.A previous reviewer, Catherine Winterfox (Portland, OR USA), sums up perfectly the 'Ooops!' moment near the end of the story...""Drew, our heroine, is heading out to the car after the hero's mother's wedding. She has to get her purse for her tampons, because her period has arrived ""with a vengeance"". Okay, fine, is the author going to use this? Maybe. Drew is kidnapped, stripped, and tied to a bed. When the hero finds her, he's afraid something horrible (well, more horrible) has happened, because she's bleeding. But no, he's referring to her arms, which are bleeding because she freed herself from the ropes binding her. Okay, not using the bleeding thing. Then, that night, they make mad, passionate love. This is a very straight couple--he'd never even had a girl on top, she couldn't identify a vibrator. They are not going to be doing anything with her bleeding. Also, she uses tampons, so there's a logistical problem. At this point, I paged back a bit just to make sure more time hadn't passed and I skimmed it. Nope, same night.It's a case of something very minor--the author using a tampon excuse to get the heroine alone to be kidnapped--turning into a major case of oops. An editor should have spotted it. I sure wish I hadn't.""And I totally agree...the mistake took away from the story. I hope someone contacts you about this and the mistake/error is correctable.",Ditto...It was fine until...
99,"I had high hopes from the blurb - a unique and intriguing premise - and the story started out great. Unfortunately, the initial drama was over much too soon, and suddenly we're thrown forward eight years and the characters have changed completely.If I'm reading a ""reformed rake"" story, I want to SEE ""Lord Wicked"" change over time and EARN his redemption. Telling the reader ""it's eight years later and he's really really sorry"" just doesn't cut it. We miss out completely on the restless, conflicted wickedness and get him tirelessly patient, self-sacrificial and boring.Likewise, I would have been much more likely to have compassion and respect for the heroine if I could have SEEN the consequences of the initial drama. Instead, we leave Jillian as a 17-year-old caught up in the aftermath of a scandalous duel and never really understand what turned her into a rude, self-centered bitch. She refuses to acknowledge her own behavior in the fiasco and blames everyone else around her.I know the author was trying for an ""independent and feisty"" heroine, but Jillian veered off that narrow path straight into ""obnoxious and unlikeable.""A reformed rake needs someone worth reforming for, and Jillian - at least in the first part of the book - definitely isn't it. And Lord Wicked was already reformed by the time he got to her, so what's the point?","Great start, but that's it"

102,"I found this story to be a nice read, but fairly predictable as to the directions of the characters. I would like to have had more build-up with the characters & more excitement with the direction they took. Because of the lack of this, the characters seemed weak & flitty, not exactly what you expect from uber-alphas. Other than that, good read.",A nice follow-up story

She kept saying she was concerned about her 10 year old boy, but she constantly ignored his feeling in pursuit of her own desires.

Then the one time that demanded her to be selfish she couldn't make the right decision until she hurt the person she now loved.I struggled to get through it.

105,I am so excited to get this book finished. It's been on my to be read shelf since I got my first nook almost two years ago. The story of Emma and Dean seems a bit dark in places and both of them keep stumbling over their own baggage and insecurities. In some ways they are their own worse enemies. It's easy to see where the title from the story comes from because there is plenty of angst in this story. But the HEA does make the story a worthy read but it does feel good to get something off my list that has been there a while,HEA makes it worth the read

111,"I actually really enjoyed this story.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it was just too short.  I wanted to read more, to find out how the characters developed and what happened to them as they made a go of their very unusual relationship.  I loved reading a book about a woman shifter.  Usually its always the men that are shifters so it was fun to read a shift through the eyes a woman.  The characters are heartwarming and really sweet.  Just wish they were a bit more fleshed out.  You get the basics but never really delve into what makes them tick.  But for the money this is a really good read!  Way to go Maya Banks!",Good but too short
112,"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).",Enjoyable Imperial slice-of-life story

115,I wish I could have gotten more of the romantic relationship. They just seemed like two people having sex. They went on one date during the entire book. And she was able to share him really easily and regret it later. My main issue with this story is how Lynda is so scared to admit her wants in the relationship for fear of losing it but the guy (I forget his name) is easily able to show what he wants. I wish she had more trust in him to be honest. I think he would have been ok with it.,I Wanted More...Spoiler Alert.
116,"I really enjoyed this book... so much so that I purchased the next in the series.  I loved the characters (some really were ""chartacters"" too!).",Humour abounds!
117,"The background story of this book is weird, bordering on the ridiculous. The inhabitants of the Galaxy (who are way beyond the humans technologically) are so damned scared of the humans, primarily because of a statement that Alexander The Great made in the past, that they literally tremble of fear just by mentioning the name Alexander. That is just so much bullocks.If you can get past the silly background story the book makes for a quite enjoyable reading. Unbelievable but enjoyable. To some small extent it reminds me of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter books. Lone hero stranded on alien planet. Of course the hero can alternate between dinner chatting, amazing speeches before the &#8220;senate&#8221; and killing dinosaurs with swords. Oh, did I mention that he is a strategically expert as well, both political and in space warfare. Not bad for a former ex-football player. As I wrote already, the story is somewhat unbelievable.Some of the book is spent with dialogues between the aliens which can become a bit tedious at times. They are still well written though. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of political intrigue and treachery going on among the aliens. Something which is definitely not my favourite topic. I found myself, perhaps not really skipping, but reading a wee bit faster on most of this so that I could get back to the chapters that were about Alexander himself instead.The book also uses the old, let&#8217;s convert our wet navy ships to space ships that have been used quite a few times in various books. I do not know why it is so popular. It is not exactly a scientifically sound concept. It would probably take at least as much time to make an old battleship airtight, not to mention all the other stuff that needs to be done, as making a new hull from scratch. Then we have other facts such as a wet navy ship would not have firing arcs on 50% of the directions in space. It is just a silly idea.The ending is fun although it is also a bit on the unbelievable side in how incredibly rapidly it plays out and the stupidity of the aliens. It does really set the stage for the next couple of books though. Some people complain about the poor editing and loads of grammar and spelling errors making the book unreadable. I have to say that I found nothing that had any great impact on the readability of the book. In general I found the book enjoyable. Maybe I got a revised version. If it had not been for the weird background story and the fact that most of the book took place down on planets it would have gotten a higher rating.",Enjoyable book despite a weird background story

I bounce through looking for the moral of the story only to skip more sex, so to see ending I see Lucy is well, and the. Couple are getting married. Marriage should have been in the beginning not the ending.",Pure filth
119,"Overall, I enjoyed this book but it wasn't all that original.  The writing was good, which is something I've come to treasure in today's market, when anyone can publish their poorly written slop without much difficulty and even best selling authors from major publishing houses are suffering a lack of editing.  For that reason alone, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal/Gothic romance.If you're not looking for characters with depth or a plot with surprising twists, you'll probably enjoy this book.There were two things that I didn't like.  (SPOILER ALERT!)  First, the way the love scenes were written gave me the impression that this author isn't really comfortable writing about sex.  When the hero and heroine made love for the first time, the tone suddenly became weirdly formal, with lines like ""It seemed imperative that their bodies meet without hindrance..."" which sort of killed the mood for me.  There were also so many flagrant metaphors (""He stirred her...like waves of a storm""; ""They poised on the edge of a volcano..."") that I totally missed the ghostly elements during that scene because I thought it was just more metaphor.  It was only at the end of the scene, when the characters started talking about what had just happened, that I even understood what the author was trying to portray.Second, I'm a retired professional musician who also has a degree in psychology, and unfortunately, this author tried to portray both a musician character and a character who suffers mental problems without doing enough research into either area.  Most people who lack my background might not notice, but for me, these flaws were glaring.  I'm not certain how this author came up with her information, but it was both inaccurate and outdated.  I realize it's nerdy to expect writers to do a little basic research before they start typing, but this kind of sloppiness tends to ruin books for me.  I can handle a bit of poetic license, but this went beyond that, straight into the realm of lazy disregard for plausibility.One other complaint: most ebooks allow the reader to jump between chapters.  This one didn't, making it very difficult to move through the book if I wanted to go back and check something I'd read before--something I often do while reading a book which involves some sort of mystery.  This really annoyed me, more than the occasion errors in the formatting did.If you're not too picky and don't expect too much, you'll probably enjoy this book.  It's not a bad way to kill an afternoon if you have nothing better to do.",Predictable Fare for Ghost Lovers
120,"The book up for review is ""Longclaws"" by Steve Peek.This novel in the genre of horror and thriller. It's one of those novels where there are two themes unfolding in alternating chapters. But they tie in together brilliantly.It starts off with creatures from a distance past. The kind of creatures legends are made out of. But people never take as having an ounce of truth in it. You are introduced to Longclaws a clan of animals that are vicious, bloodthirsty yet protective of their own. But they are not alone in this unforgiving world. The reader is taken on an adventure as the book describes them beautifully where you can imagine in your mind what is being written. Kudos on that alone. The picture has been painted well.Enter the Mason family who has a history and knowledge of the creatures. They are the keepers of the entrance that separates our world from theirs. It is imperative the doors remain close. For the alternative would involve chaos and destruction for both worlds.This book starts off a little slow. However I encourage the reader to keep reading.  The twists and turns that comes off the pages will keep your interest as you wonder what happens next. I am always amazed at authors who can create a unique and different world.

122,"Even though I recently just found Ms. Andre as a writer of erotica and erotic, I absolutely love her books.  This one was no exception.  I enjoyed the premise of three friends on a weekend in wine country, CA.  The description of the vineyards and town made me want to visit the area.  Each character has about 1/3 of the book devoted to her; each story within the book was very good and different.  I loved the first two characters in the first and second parts: Carrie and Rose . . . absolutely fell in love with the chef for more reasons than one, gee he cooks!  Rose's story was the most believable to me (though who really cares how believable it was).  Vanessa was my least favorite character, matter of fact; I really didn't care for her at all until the end, then I changed my mind about her.  However, FOR ME, Vanessa's weekend was by far, one of the most erotic stories I have ever read . . . the words, scenarios and feelings portrayed were beautiful; at one point, I had tears running down my cheeks because the writing was so poignant . . . wow!

123,"I would best describe ths novel as a romantic thriller/mystery. Probably more of a thriller as it has more of an international flavour. Set in the art world it is filled with spies and political intrigue.Kay McCann is an artist, a Master Artist. She has been involved with two very different men, Peter Lawson a world renowned painter and Jason Allen a gallery owner and expert in art forgeries. Each man has their own agenda where Kay is concerned, each man is manipulative and coldly calculating. Kay unwittingly becomes a pawn between the two men.I enjoyed the premise for this novel. I couldn't quite decide who Kay would ultimely end up with. Kay was a well written character, open, generous and forgiving. IMO too forgiving at times. I did have some qualms for Kay, as she was quite blinded and naive with both Peter and Jason. For a Master Artist who was able to convey so much emotion through her art I expected her to be more &#34;worldly&#34; or aware of what was happening around her,  the repercussions of her actions.I did enjoy this but I do agree with another reviewer that the pace did lag a bit in the middle and it wasn't all tied up as neatly at the end as I would have liked.

And this cover is on so many books that aren't any good. But it was free, so I figured i would kill a few minutes reading it. My suspicions were confirmed from the very first page, when it described Elf as being a graying, and very crusty old woman. I just knew that it was going to be a boring story.And a very boring story it was. I had to finish it, so that I could honestly review it.

125,"Another well written story by Julie Miller. I really enjoyed reading it. Jack and Alex have a 15 year age difference between them but I like stories like these. I find the age difference to be kind of sweet. I only felt that the beginning was a little hard to accept.Unless I'm mistaken about his duty time, I would have liked for Jack and Alex to have met as they did while Jack was not on duty. He really knew nothing about her and for him to get this intimate with her in this type of situation didn't seem like an honorable decision. She really could have turned out to be much younger than she had told him she was. It also didn't work because immediately after being assaulted by one man she just met, she got intimate with another man she just met. Some of their scenes take place in car but it was a little confusing exactly how they were positioned. Also, just a small pet peeve of mine of littering, one of the characters just simply opens the window and dumps ""something"" right onto the street and he was a cop.Once you get past their initial meeting, the story is good with a good amount of suspense and romance!",Enjoyable

135,"This book was bad on every level.The plot was pretty much nonexistent. There was a small thread of ""escape Bedlam"" that was just unbelievable and after pages and pages of nothing it was accomplished in a spur of the moment afterthought way.  From what I could gather the plot line consisted of absurd sex scenes (really? hours after meeting a filthy, epileptic crazy man she is ""tiddling"" on the floor of an insane asylum with him? really?) interspersed with, well, not much more.The hero was a sniveling, blushing ""genius"" with no real depth.  If he blushed or ""brushed away a tear"" again I might have had to break my kindle.  The heroine was a self-centered little sleaze.  Her first concern was always the crazy man she had just met, not her totally incoherent sister or anyone else who had been there for her through all of her troubles.The editing started out okay, for a cheap kindle book, but it was almost like by the end even the editor/proofreader was just skimming as the spelling and punctuation errors increased dramatically.The dialogue was unbelievable and almost painful to read.  The H & h's soliloquies of ""love and devotion"" were nauseating in the way they went on and on and on page after page all the way through.  We get it, they love each other like no one has ever loved before and will be there for each other forever and would give up their lives for the other.  There were times when a character would use a phrase or word that was just not true to the time but in the whole scheme of how bad this book was this was minor.I am still not sure what the heck happened in the ending.  I know there were tears and ""happily ever after"" with the promise of more to come---not for this reader though!--after a silly chase scene where it all ""came together"" and all made sense to everyone---not!The supporting characters were as inane and uninspiring as the mains---none were developed in a way that made them feel like real contributing parts of the story.There is so much more I could comment on that made this book bad, but I have already wasted too much time I will never get back on it.",So much bad

137,"I found it interesting that there is no continuous protagonist to this book.  Yes there are a few critical characters established in the early chapters but once their contribution is complete the book does a good job of shifting gears from fun engineering nerdiness to a pretty serious military Sci-Fi.  In fairness, the early characters never leave the story as they show up to give philosophical observations and to give some technological nudges to the plot.I do highly recommend it though and I'm very curious to read the next in the series.  If I had one niggling criticism it would be all the similarities between the alien species to ourselves.  It's a little too star trek-ish for my personal tastes but most folks will probably be cool with it.  A good solid 4 to 4-1/2 star read.",Interesting enough.

I was hooked enough to buy the last novel just to see how it ended, hence the second star. Am I bashing this work because I'am a prude or a religious do-gooder, ""NO""., but if the the sexual relations where deleted there wouldn't be much of a story left and what's left is not believeable at least to any-one with military experience or common sense.The facts: this series had a huge potential, the science isn't bad, and the main character loveable, many battle scenes well described, but five stars this work is not.","""GET REAL' WITH THESE RATINGS"

I immediately formed a perfect picture in my mind of Bret, Lisa and Leo and watching it play out before me in the written word just proved to me that as far as an erotic paranormal writer goes, you are on top.  The story maybe short but the reader will not feel short changed when finished.  I guess if there are really vampires out there, they need somewhere to go where they can let their hair hang down and not hide what they are but revel in it.

142,"Only In My Dreams is the fifth book in Dana Marie Bell's Halle Puma series. Though this is the first book in the series that I've read, I was able to follow most of the characters and relationships without too much difficulty, with the few secondary plot situations that remained a mystery to me detracting very little from Gabe and Sarah's story.Ms. Bell does an excellent job of building sexual tension. I was enraptured by Gabe, who is clearly the dominate in his erotic dreams with Sarah. But Sarah manages to hold her own. Her submissiveness to him has its limits, even in his dreams, which surprises but doesn't disappoint him. He is disappointed, however, by her continued mistrust in him, though he is sensitive enough to recognize he is the one mostly at fault.I really enjoyed Only In My Dreams and look forward to adding many of Ms. Bell's books to my TBR pile. - Kathryn",4 Hearts from TRS!

149,"Judith Ivie has had a twenty-five plus career writing and editing. As a Connecticut native, she sets her latest Kate Lawrence mystery in Hartford and Wethersfield. She has an eager audience on the East Coast. A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is her third Kate Lawrence mystery, and she has published three non-fiction books.Kate Lawrence is undergoing several lifestyle changes at once: her long-time love, Armando, is moving in with her; her daughter is stretching her wings and has a new boyfriend; and her son is incommunicado with new exploits. To add to this, a telephone call from a couple of elderly spinsters who live in a grand old historic mansion reveals an actual skeleton in a closet that has been bricked up for forty some years. Kate is in the real estate business with a couple of lively women partners, and they rush over to be of assistance to the confused little old ladies. But by the time Kate rushes to their aid, the body has disappeared:""A pile of old bricks, mortar, splintered wood and other debris attested to the recent demolition of a narrow section of wall at the back of a closet next to a huge, ancient furnace. The new opening revealed a narrow space. John's flashlight shone on the pipes leading to the ancient boiler, one of which was leaking visibly. On the floor at the rear of the closet next to the pipes lay something that looked like a rag along with more bits of mortar and brick. I thought the cloth was dark blue, but I couldn't be certain. Except for some shelving filled with books and files along the back wall of the closet-like space, it was empty. I blinked and looked again. No body, no bones, nothing.""A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is a delightful cozy mystery, New England style. One can almost imagine Kate Lawrence as a younger version of Jessica Fletcher. Her fiery romance with the elegant Armando contributes romance, and her friends and fellow realtors provide glamour and humor. Kate is undergoing a midlife crisis of sorts, which actually grounds her and provides the reader with a glimpse of a middle-aged adventurer.

Penny and Jace were such engaging characters, making great equal partners when it was called for, but also falling easily into the more traditional roles of meek woman and strong, protective man at other times, and it was fascinating to see the movement back and forth between the two. The mistaken assumptions on both sides throughout the story became frustrating and by the end it was heartbreaking to see the characters following through with noble actions that neither of them wanted.

The plot is decent, as is the writing. This is the book you read when you're bored & have an idle afternoon.I did enjoy all the design elements the author included, so there was actually some focus on something other than the hero & heroine drooling over each other. The information Kinson used was interesting & dropped into the story easily. I didn't find the characters either annoying or compelling. They were there, kinda cute, & helped the story move. I really couldn't care less about them, but I'm glad the book ended the way it did.

I found the writer's style is impossibly circuitous, overly detailed.Maybe it's her ""Type-Every-Single-Random-Thought-That-Comes-In-My-Head"" style. (It's too much!) Or maybe it's that this book would have been better off left as a blog or a magazine article. Was she just trying to pad her stories with details to fill an entire book?She has good points to make, but good luck follwing her long winded & meandering paragraphs to get to a gem.

166,"Title: Your Health - Your pH: How to Reverse Illness and Gain VitalityAuthor: Amy MosherReviewer: George ShadowSummary:Book is all about the body's pH level and the general impact the latter has on one's health at any given time. Concise and brimming with very important information and wisdom, YOUR HEALTH - YOUR PH: HOW TO REVERSE ILLNESS AND GAIN VITALITY is a piece of work everybody should read. It shows you how to know your body pH levels and what to take away from this reading; how to pinpoint the problems your body is undergoing owing to low pH readings; how to reverse the deterioration caused; as well as how to non-physically arrest these debilitating issues through a certain mental frame of mind.Social/Historical Context:Okay, doctor visits can be costly, agreed. We collectively spend millions every year paying for these visits, and I am not talking of the many who are actually sick and need a cure. No, I am talking of those who can prevent their ailments had they known the many secrets of healthy living. And one of these secrets include that funny abbreviation called pH. Yes, how acidic or alkaline our body fluids are is very important to our body systems. Author Amy Mosher starts us on a journey we'll all be grateful for in her book, YOUR HEALTH - YOUR PH: HOW TO REVERSE ILLNESS AND GAIN VITALITY. How this journey ends depends entirely on us.Writing Style:Written in simple English, the book's intent is to convey its message without confusion, and it does this brilliantly. No muddled up scientific jargon, I tell you! Everything is laid out in nonprofessional terms, and when there is a need for some intellectual words, these are quickly broken down in the ensuing paragraphs.My Thoughts:A lot of research went into writing this book. I was impressed by this fact when I finished reading the book. Author Amy Mosher has done every one of us a favor by writing this book, and I mean it. Gosh, I never knew Aloe Vera is a healthy edible, that fish contains mercury, a highly acidic mineral, and that hydrogenated or trans fats are very bad news! And what of diet coke?

175,"This book deals with an issue that I have never come across before in a romance novel. That is the infidelity of the heroine. Usually in romance novels, its a real turn off to find out either the hero or the heroine had strayed to 'greener pastures'. Most of the time rather than actually actually committing the act of infidelity, there is a misunderstanding between the hero and the heroine which is always later resolved in the novel. However it is not the case in the story of Katie and Cutter.In the first book of this series which I didn't read but was able to make out what happened by reading this book, Katie sleeps with Justin Cruz, now husband of Cutter's sister Dani Standifer. Although Katie was in a relationship with Cutter at that time, no matter how wrong infidelity is, Katie was feeling vulnerable and alone cos Cutter wouldn't really open up to her and give her what she needed.Katie has regretted sleeping with Justin from the moment Cutter finds out what happened between the two. Resolving never to let Katie into his life again, which is a bargain he has held till now, seeing Katie gatecrash Dani's wedding party is the last straw for Cutter. Thinking Katie had come to mourn over Justin, Cutter treats Katie like trash and takes what he has always wanted from her. Katie gives herself to Cutter thinking that she might get a second chance to work things out with him if she lets him have his way with her.These two embark on a purely sexual relationship, the consequence of which renders Katie pregnant. I felt that this story was too rushed and thus the resolving of the conflict between Katie and Cutter didn't quite give the satisfaction that I was craving as the reader. This story would have been much better and a more memorable one if the author had taken time to actually develop Katie and Cutter's characters a bit more and resolve the trust issues Cutter had with Katie in a more believable manner rather than just all of a sudden confessing that he loves Katie and wants her to be his wife.Anyhow okay for a quick read that doesn't require much thinking on the reader's part.",Actually 2 and 1/2 star
176,"This really should be a longer book for the amount of sex portrayed. Because they characters were so busy having sex (female with two males, two males with each other and the female), there didn't seem time enough to develop the characters. An attempt to do so is made (in that they worry about how to tell their families that they are in a polyamorous relationship), but I really would have enjoyed this if I'd been more invested in the characters and their lives before they all had rampant sex (as hot as it was). If you're looking for a hot read and don't care about whether you feel compassion or any sense of connection with the characters, dive in (I'm sure there's room for more people in the bed). If you like stories that first establish what kinds of characters are around and who does what with whom and why, then save this for a time when you need a read that doesn't do that.This really felt like I'd jumped into the middle of a story without knowing who the characters were ahead of time.",Three stars for hot steamies...

183,"I enjoyed this book, and unlike another reviewer, I didn't really find the characterizations thin.  I liked Henry, and I thought his living arrangements had a lot of potential in subsequent books (and boy, would I like his house!).  I also liked the amount of detail that was given. Another reviewer referred to it as 'padding'.  Maybe it is, but I also liked the way it gave the story immediacy - you felt like you were right there, watching the goings-on.  The concept of a retired police chief helping out with current cases is no more or less implausible than most of the premises for most mysteries.  All things considered, most police departments nowadays would jump on the chance to have an expert, unpaid, consultant available!  I thought that the plot was interesting, the victim just 'shady' enough to be realistic.  My big gripe, if it can be called that, was with the ending when the murderer was revealed.  I don't necessarily dislike the author's decision on who should be First Murderer, but I didn't like the way he presented it - it was too sudden, too abrupt, and the clues leading to their identity were a bit too subtle and got lost in the shuffle, so to speak. If the author had eased Henry into his realization of who the murderer was more gradually and provided one more clue that pointed to that person, I think the ending would've been immeasureably improved.  All in all, this was a pleasant, easy read with a bit of a twist at the end.  I'd recommend it.Note on Kindle formatting:  Good.  There were a couple of issues, but nothing to distract from the reading experience.",Quite good

189,"I didn't like how she kept referencing people, places, things and the quoting from the bible. All the name dropping in this book makes it hard to continue reading it. When I start a book I like to finish it, but this book makes me want to stop reading it and move on to the next book. If all her other books are like this I won't be buying them.",Mrs

191,"I don't generally read short stories, as I find they leave me wanting more, and this book was no exception. I think the characters could have been developed a little better, I didn't really get a good sense of how the characters were feeling. I think with a little work this book could actually be something, but as is, it just reiterated to me that I need to stick with what I like, and short stories are not it.",Good Concept
192,"I got this book for my Kindle free; after reading I'm really glad I didn't pay anything for it. The storyline had the potential for a good ""Twilight Zone"" kind of story, but was just too lightweight to make it. The author seems to feel the need to put in really XX rated sex scenes - she seemed to love to be able to use the word c**k. I didn't find this adding anything to the story, and only finished it because it's a fairly short book.",Could have been good
193,"It's been since 2010, when I first got my Kindle, that I've read this series. I want to say the first book was either free or pretty cheap or I could have even splurged and purchased it. However it was discovered, I ended up purchasing the other two in the series because I became obsessed! I was disappointed when I had to wait for the fourth book in the series but I found out a little later that it was put on hold because of personal reasons. I hoped everything was ok and kept checking back. But imagine my surprise when I just found out recently the fourth was released in October of 2013!! And Sydney herself asked if I would like to review it. So I offered to re-read the first three and review the whole series here. So this is where we find ourselves here now, on the second day of our Sydney Somers week. (If you missed it yesterday, we had an exclusive cover reveal for a novella prequel to her Pendragon Gargoyles series. I even had the privilege of designing it!!!) So enough about my babble and let's get to the good stuff. :)We are immediately pulled into the story with Kennedy, who is the bartender at Pendragon's which is owned by Tristan and his siblings, threatening to hose down (with the water sprayer behind the bar) the hot to trot Tristan and another patron who were on the way to getting into a fight. I immediately thought, &lt;em>well this is going to be good&lt;/em>. I could tell immediately, even through Kennedy's POV, that Tristan is an alpha from the jump so the hose thing took some lady balls on her part. But this event essentially kicked off the madness and heart pounding events of the story. Kennedy is sucked into the enchanting world of paranormal beings she had no clue existed. And she finds that she can no longer ignore the powerful draw she feels towards the mysterious Tristan. But there is danger that is lurking in the shadows, hanging the threat of death over her head. Talk about a downer.But Tristan is there to do anything he can to keep her safe. Including giving up his chance to unfreeze his brother from his constant gargoyle state. Throw in a bunch of action and some hot lovin', and you've got one guy I totally want at my back...and front. ;) I love a good alpha male but I also love when they are all,&#34;do what I say now woman!&#34; and then the next it's, &#34;you are everything to me.&#34; It's enough to turn me to mush in a hot second. I loved how protective he is of Kennedy. And one part of the story had my heart aching for him and wanting to take all his hurts away. I was rooting hard for the two of them! And I was so happy with the outcome!This story has a ton of action and I loved how the tale of King Arthur and Merlin. My inner history nerd was having a field day with this new spin. It's so creative how everything is woven around some things we know, like the knights of the round table. I just loved it!!Check back each the rest of the week for the next three reviews!!",Love this Series!!
194,"I found this story entertaining and much too short. The story opens with a couple who has been married for six years.  The wife suspects her husband of keeping a mistress after she finds a diamond bracelet in their drawers and then later finds out that she was not the recipient of said bracelet when bracelet disappears. He picked up the bracelet for his brother unbeknownst to his wife, so the misunderstanding begins.Armed with her suspicions, the wife feels she needs to shake up their marriage and win her husband back from the arms of the phantom mistress. The books begins when she announces over breakfast that she wants to take on a lover. Her husband is reading the paper and not paying attention to the conversation, agrees with everything she says.  She feels that after six years of marriage and two children, their marriage has become dull and is concern that her husband has or will look for a mistress to spice things up.The two still love each other very much, but marriage for them has become somewhat a rut after six years.  So what does this couple do? They go through the charade of finding her a lover. He tells her he wants to help select her lover. She agrees and then blackmails his twin brother to pretend to be her lover and pursue her anonymously. Her husband also seeks help from his brother to play the role of the lover and pursue her (but not bed her), so she does not have the time to seek another lover. Neither is aware that the brother is the only one privy to the dual roles he is playing.In the end, the husband realizes that he had been taking his wife for granted and has not lived up to his promises of giving her the adventure he spoke of during their courtship. He also admits to his brother and himself of recently developing a wondering eye and possessing a feeling of restlesstness  He knows that he has been neglecting her and not telling her how much he loved her and that he was the one  responsible for allowing their marriage to fall into a rut. He then likens his comfortable marriage to an untended garden. That was a good analogy.I thought this was a sweet story, but felt it could have been longer with more detailed flashbacks regarding their courtship. I only caught glimpses of the wonderment that she wanted to recapture from the days of their courtship. I like stories with married couples who are not fighting. One sticking issue with me is the reference of the wandering eye. If you are as in love with your wife as you claim to be - should you have a wandering eye?  I had to deduct a star for these references.This is the second novel I read from this author and I am very impressed with her writing abilities to capture details of the moment.A recommend.",Scratching the Six Year Itch...a 3.5 stars ..it would have been higher if the story was more developed...
195,"PJVs QUICKIE POV: A smoking hot threesome packed full of vamps, determined heroines and two not just one sexy men.REVIEW: Set in the year 2069, in this futuristic world vampires frolic in all types of sensory explicit behavior at clubs called Midnight Playgrounds. The London club has been calling to Nissa ever since she found out about them. Determined to gain entrance to the club and maybe one day even into the ranks of the undead, Nissa finally makes a contact that gets her invited.On her fist night at the club, Nissa is intent of full-filling her most darkest fantasies - and the Midnight Playground is just the place to do so. Drawn to the upper floors Nissa comes upon Hex and his maker Aleron. Lovers and friends for 10 years they have had no desire to add to their ranks - only to have fun with the humans that visit the club.Nissa immediately strikes them as different thought. Intelligent, sensual and beautiful, Hex is drawn to her like no other - and while he has shared The Seeking Kiss, blood exchange between a vampire and their human lover, with others, he has had no inclination to share the Turning Kiss with one, until now.Interesting and sexy, I did enjoy this one and hope to read more from Ms. Bradley. I found Hex & Aleron's relationship very sexy and a change from the usual - buddies sharing a chick - which is what I've read before in menage erotica.Another short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for $2.80 here. I love a good book deal!RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, this is a smut fest, erotica novel. Vampires, threesomes and a lot of slaps and tickles.",A hot vamp trio...
196,"Bill Morison relates his experiences as a novice work comp auditor for a large insurance company, a job he finds pointless and boring, in a book that is unfortunately pointless and boring.I'm usually a fan of workplace humor.  Ideally, the author strips away the mundane majority of the work experience, leaving only the enjoyable and/or amusing bits.  Unfortunately, this author manages to find only mundanity.  For instance, he spends more than 200 mundane words (""There was a path leading from the parking lot to the pavilion. [...] It was at this entrance that I found the standard park grill."") describing the pavilion at which the company picnic was held - a description with absolutely no relevance to any of the picnic events.  He describes the teambuilding games at the picnic as ""worthless,"" provides no other information beyond a listing of games, and then tells the reader that they were the most fun he'd had at the company.  If they were fun, then show the fun!Leaving aside my lack of appreciation of the author's humor, this book has other flaws.- It contains a random creepy advertisement for another of his books,Legon Awakening: Book One in the Legon Series.  ""It's so good and the author's voice--so hot,"" and ""...but he does have a sexy voice and the story is great,"" says Bill's coworker Adrian.- It contains random and uninteresting IM conversations between Bill (screen name Bmorisson, or sometimes Bmorrison, but never an accurate spelling of his last name) and Adrian (screen name HorseChick - there's got to be a story behind *that* as your workplace IM name, but unfortunately we don't learn what it is).Bmorisson ""hey you're on the EAC right?""HorseChick ""yeah why? If your going to complain about the pot luck last week I don't want to hear it; wasn't my idea""Bmorisson ""chill. I wasn't going to say anything about that. I'm supposed to be in the meeting this week; does that mean I'm on the committee? Oh and pot lucks are dumb.""HorseChick ""lol don't make me walk over there! [...]""- The dialogue is stilted, superfluous, or both.""Hey bro, how's it going?""""I'm good, you?""""I'm doing good.""- Compound words are written as two separate words (pot luck, ""Halloween was making a come back""), and separate words as compound words (""Everyday, he wore khaki pants with a faded polo"").  Not just once or twice, but over and over.- Sentences are randomly strung together.  ""It was a local number some 720 one.""- The author picks the wrong word.  ""She straitened a bit.""  ""My arms were wound around her waste..."" ""...women that all wore sandals, heals, flip flops..."" ""It sounds like your trying to get rid of me."" ""Never did loosing your job seem to affect me.""Two stars because the grammatical issues aren't bad enough to make the book completely unreadable, and because the last 30% is significantly better than the first 70%.  Not enough better to make it worth slogging through the first part, but enough better that ruthless rewrites might have some chance to save it.",An actual work comp audit would be more fun

Hero decides to finally do something about his insistent hot dreams about heroine and wants to know more about her  now that he saw her have a panic attack at the gym. Her honest answers don't sway his decisions about her and that's enough for her to yield to him. But the morning after has her questioning their relationship. Did he push her too soon?Overall, a sweet and sexy novella. The long-awaited romance between the main characters' mutual infatuation with each other was wrapped up too quickly to be utterly believable and healthy. Their relationship barriers were all resolved in 2 days.  And heroine had major issues that made their 2 days together seemed dysfuctional.** This book would've been much better if their coming together was extended at least a week's time.

210,"Twilight in the Spaces BetweenEditing is terrible and interferes with reading flow.  Foul language and prejudicial sentiments expressed.  Twilight has more than it's share of perversion, rage and hate.  There are many ""babies of rabies"" in this tale.  Only a cleansing fire can make it right.Text contains contradictory imaging (""Five years of bone dry summers and rainy seasons without rain has turned Kisatchie into kindling waiting for the match.""  ""Andrea steps to the edge of the platform and looks down to see her reflection in an oily pool of water."")  This is only one example of inattention to detail.  There is absolutely genius imaging (""...the basketball hits the asphalt, the sound is like a fist striking flesh"" creating a visceral image and completely clueless imaging such as ""An impossible sun...wasted sky..."".  What exactly does that mean?The protagonists are both victims and are trying to find ways to make the suffering go away--opposite sides of the same coin.  Even though the disorganization of the story--multiple characters continually switch with one another between the present and the past--reflects the mental state of both Clive and Andrea, it makes the story very hard to follow.  When Andrea finds transportation to Twilight the sounds she hears, the body she finds, and the location of the car are completely lost as the story progresses.The story is jerky making it hard to read, but the phrasing is vivid drawing you in.  This novel has a split personality and actually reads like two rather than one author.  One author I would read again, the other one I can live without.Definitely a book you will not soon forget!",Sometimes Wonderful Sometimes Lacking
211,"When I first started this book, I didn't think I would like it.  There was so much information given in the beginning, that I got bored.  I understand why the author took us way back to when Payton and Lizzie met.  I just didn't understand why there was so much information and some of it really didn't do anything for the story.  This book probably could have been 4 chapters shorter and it still would have been fine.  There were other things that the author did later in the book that I didn't understand.  Why make Lou Anne part of the master plan?  Why would a grown man take his grown date back to the HS cafeteria for a pizza date?  I know that the author tried to throw in some story about when they were teenagers and he took her to the cafeteria, but it seemed like an afterthought.  That little tidbit should have been included in all the other information in the beginning of the story.  I didn't find the prom thing romantic or fitting to the story at all.  I think it would have been more romantic at Granny's Pond or the barn that held the first barn party he invited her to as his date.  There were some things I didn't like and others that I did.  As the story went on, the writing did get better.  I did actually want to find out what happened.  This wasn't a bad read, but I don't think I'll read it again.",2.5 to 3 stars

215,"Why do people read fantasy? Why do they want to believe in magic? Is it something to do with religion? Who knows? Some academic somewhere has probably written a paper on the subject. My hunch is that it's related deep down to a desire for happy endings, common in we humans. As a skeptical guy who has a handle on reality (I like to think so) I've never read much fantasy - although I do like the Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter movies, which is something of a contradiction I suppose (like the man who reads Playboy for the articles I watch fantasy movies for the special effects). If you're like me and you're searching for an introduction to a genre that you might have previously avoided, you could do a lot worse than read these stories. The secret is to suspend disbelief and go with the flow. Don't allow logic or reason to interfere. These fantasies do what they need to do: ensure that good triumphs over evil, that magic wins out in the end, that friends and family are important, and that endings are always happy (well, happy-ish anyway). Along the way, you might even learn a thing or two about herbs.",Suspend disbelief and go with the flow

Frankly, I think the length is one of the things that makes it as scary as it is. To take these 2 serial killers and put that much information and fear into one chapter for each of them then to bring them together in another chapter that wraps things up nicely, totally works for me. I also like the way the 2 authors worked independently and still made the story cohesive.After reading King and Koontz for the past 40 years and watching horror films longer than that, I really enjoyed this story. However, if you are squeamish don't read this.The way this was written intrigued me. I have read a few anthologies that are by a group of authors connecting their stories to make a whole.

I almost always enjoy her stories to a varying degree, from good to very good except this story.  Oh...and except Velvet Cataclysm which I didn't like at all. Her writing style in this book is a bit like poetry in the way she uses her words.  Okay maybe not poetry but I don't know the word to describe it so here is an example. ""The amount of incendiary material he'd built up for Grace must have been monumental."" See what I mean?  The whole story is written like this, different.Now on to my thoughts about this story.First off Grace is NOT Trick's mother-in-law.  She was married to Trick's father Evan, so she is his stepmother!  Grace is described as his mother-in-law several times in the story, talk about confusing and not a good start to this book.  This story did get a bit better as it unfolded and the characters took shape for me.Trick was an asshat to Grace from the word go.  Grace was a strong, assertive woman with everyone but...Trick.  For the most part, Grace was Tricks whippy post, figuratively speaking that is--and she let him.  That's the part I disliked most, her hypnotic like acceptance of his treatment.  I understood it sure and it was explained at the end but I don't have to like it though.Then there was the mad dash to the end of the story where explanations' and secrets were revealed.  His reaction to these secrets was not what I expected meaning not much of a reaction.  No outrage or anger. The ending was just too rushed for me. I needed more closure.",Okay/Good

First, the book has a lot of sex that could have been steamy but it felt to me that too often Ty's reaction to what he was being told to do was negative. Second, I'm not sure I buy Ty' s declaration of love at the end...maybe...but it bugs me...it's like I was asked to flip a switch and now he loves her because of one realization.

I don't usually like when one half of the couple seems to be contributing to the relationship more than the other half but, although Laine looks like the typical damsel in distress, he's also loving and caring and he tries somewhat to get himself out of the trouble he's in.* Layne: he's too cute to be true, but I read about him with a big smile on my face all the time and sometimes I just want to feel good.* I couldn't put it down, it was fast, a light and fun read, a book I'd recommend as a pick-me-up.What I didn't like:* The fight scene didn't satisfy me. It seemed it was edited away, I don't know how to explain it. It felt too rushed, although it had the potential for something more exciting. Maybe it's because it's a short story, but I found the romance was ok, it lacked a bit of action (or angst, even if I admit I prefer the angst at a tolerable level and mine is pretty low).All in all my rating is 3.5 stars.

I thought the concept for this story was genuinely intriguing but it seemed like there just wasn&#8217;t enough time in the book for it to be fully developed.  You can feel free to call me greedy, but I wanted more of a chance to get to know these characters.  The suspense/thriller part of the plot ended up feeling rushed, which is a shame because the idea of someone hunting Magian girls in their own ritual spaces sounds like the makings of a great story.The sex scenes were steamy.

I loved Bobby's irreverence, Cale's sweet, tender caring, and Kate's up-front honesty. The passion was intense and the romance/love story beautiful. A great little erotic novella!",A great 5-star erotic novella!
236,"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process).  At times I found myself mentally substituting ""outer space"" for ""under sea,"" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that,  the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island.","Classic of science fiction, some minor flaws to a modern reader"
237,"OK, This book was really really great. I  stumbled upon it on my Kindle and purchased it mosly becasue it was cheap.I loved Alex and I found myself laughing out loud a number of times. When the friend walks in on them in the middle of some hot vampire loving and blood play. I thought I might Piss myself. This of course lead me to read the entire series on three days flat.As much as I loved it I really did not love the ending but if you read the series then you get the update that you want and need.Happy Hot Reading,The best might me the last book.","Vamp who drinks soup, who loves the food Network!

242,"I really liked the idea, and the sample pulled me in, so I bought the rest of the story. It satrted off OK but just seemed to fizzle out in the end. Not even the revenge secen seemed th have much oomph. I was actually glad to get to the end, and relieved it was a novella.

A good choice to while away an evening in interesting and engrossing light fantasy. An easy to read and easy to follow type of fiction.

He runs into her a grocery store, she tries to hide from him - she had been avoiding him.  She moved out 2 weeks after they had drank a bottle of tequila and Justin kissed her.  So they made out - then she moved out - without a word, no note - nothing.  Justin is giving up that easy, he wants Gabby - and he will do anything to convince her.  There is talk of domestic violence but, it only to develop the background plot - doesn't really play into the main story line.This is another story about how a friendship becomes more.  However, what made this a story good was the balance of emotion and detail.  This story was very short - but has impact.",Short but...worth the read!

All 5 guys say how much they respect her and yet, they perform some really hot sex on her.  All the while, she is bound and gagged a good majority of the time.  Then, at the end, the ring leader professes his love for her and the other guys just walk away?Like I said, I have mixed feelings about this book.  Some of its too far fetched, comes really too close to out and out rape.  But, the sex was so hawt.  Wow.  Never been on the fence about a book before....Only you can decide for yourself anyway...",mixed
250,"Yes, it is a very short story with graphic sex and is sweet without being too saccharine.  It does not have a lot of details or story line but for a quick free read it was worth the time.Chloe is a very shy introvert that is set up by her sister with Mark, wealthy(of course) but with scars.  They have sex, fall in love, separate because of misunderstandings and then, of course, HEA.Not much to it as others reviewers have mentioned but I did enjoy reading the book unlike some other short, free reads I have downloaded.  I really did not have high expectations especialy based on the length of the book but it did give me a sample of the writing style of the author and I may give one of her longer books a try.If your looking for something with a lot of plot and ""meat"" to it - pass on this book.

253,"This is the third book in Lila Dubois's Monster in Hollywood romance series.  I read the first book,Lights, Camera...Monsters: Monsters in Hollywood, Book 1but skipped the second bookMy Fair Monster: Monsters in Hollywood, Book 2.  I don't think I missed anything important to the plot of this book by skipping the second book, though I'm not sure if book three could be a stand alone, without book one setting up the monsters and everything.Runako, the male lead in this book was the villain in the first book.  He is angry at humans because they tortured and killed his twin sister, and so he doesn't want the Monster movie to be made.  However, after losing a battle with Luke, Runako is forced to change into human form.  There is instant attraction between Runako and Margo, the producer for the Monster movie.  This book starts with Runako abducting Margo off of the street, and taking her to a ""Captives Cave"" in the Rockies.  At the start, Margo is very much Runako's prisoner, and he chains her to a rock alter in the cave.  Runako has a great sense of smell in his monster form, so he can tell that Margo is attracted to him, and enjoys what he does to her, even if her words tell a different story.  Runako definitely has issues, he is still very upset about the death of his twin sister, and human nature.  Margo has some body and control issues.  Runako and Margo work to help each other overcome these issues.This book has more action than the first book in the series.  I enjoy reading thrillers, so I loved the action scenes.  The reader may have to let go a bit of reality to find the action scenes believable, but you're already reading a book about monster/human love, so it shouldn't be hard to just let a little more go.  This book also introduces additional monsters, as well as showing more about monster life, since location is primarily by Runako's home in the Rockies.  Like the other books in the series, this also includes a lot of monster/human sex.Overall, I'm happy with the decision to purchase the third book in the series.",Runako's story

255,"I read this one and thought it was interesting but...when you spend as much time getting to the ""crux of the matter"" and then rush things with nothing more than two kisses, a lick and a quick first time DP...well, it just seemed less than sexy to me.  I'm not sure if I'll read another offering from this author as there was nothing remotely romantic, nor wickedly sexy, in this one as far as I am concerned.","Apparently... witches don't like, nor require, foreplay."
256,I liked these stories very much.  Bulldog wages unconventional war against unconventional criminals and succeeds using methods that are noble but normal police cannot use.  I enjoy his 'bigger than life' personality and abilities and recommend this for a truly enjoyable read.Richard Pendleton,BULLDOG IS A WINNER
257,"I enjoyed this novel. This to me was more of an action adventure as opposed to romance. Yes, There are 2 'love' scenes in it, but one the author described as rushed kind of affair... and the other happens in the end.Truly this is an adventury kind of book. My husband asked me what I was reading and I told him a book that reminded me of that Kevin Costner movie ""The Postman"" (1*997).You have breakdown of a society..our world. So picture the whole 'postman' setting- people living without electricty and the like. There is one community/colony where Dan and other cool people (I really like the characters she puts in place) live together to stay safe. Of course- in this world we have to have some drama- so there is a band of bad guys- so we have those too.Now Dan comes across Selena in a scouting kinda thing. And I won't give anything away. But the story is all about her either joining the community or not, and keeping her safe.",Nice novel.

Matthieu Docet, an avenger. comes to warn Cody that his family may be in danger as Cody's name has recently come up in a fight with &#34;some especially cruel and powerful sorcerers.&#34; Matthieu is available to help if needed. Cody is not that surprised by the news as he has been having dreams and visions of monsters and things. The bad drought is also not helping Cody feel any better as the ranch is losing money. He has to do something and sooner than he thinks!Along with all that, Cody is in a 'red-dirt' band enjoying all kinds of music but mostly southern rock or gospel and leads worship at a local cowboy church. Cody's family on his father's side have all died before the age of 30. Why? What do Cody's dreams all mean?Who is Brandon Stone in Ravanna, AR and how can he help Cody?Now meet Lisa, who has just moved back into town after 8 -10 years. She is at nursing school and working part time at the Dairy Dip. Cody was the first boy to have kissed her when she was 12. Her mother is a stroke victim so in need of care. What will she say when she finds out the truth about Cody? Will love bring them both through? At one point in this story, I have to admit that Lisa's naivete was a little too much to swallow. Yes, she tries to help Cody but goodness, at 21, she should have had a bit more sense!Cody's wish: &#34;In the beauty of love may life be finished: to the glory of God may all things come to completion.&#34;This story is written in both Cody and Lisa's words with the chapters interchanging. The author lets you know who is talking so there is no confusion.The quality of the writing is not polished BUT there are not any spelling errors so I have to give the author a big thumbs up for that! HOWEVER I wish the author's little snippet had actually disclosed what was in this book! When the book starts it is a very sweet love story but then changes to become much &#34;darker.&#34; Yes it is clean as in no sex but zombies, a sorceress and crystals are very present. SO be warned! If you do not like mixing Christianity with zombies etc you will not enjoy this book. If you do, then chances are you will enjoy this book.In writing this review, I kept my personal opinions to myself so that I could describe the quality of the writing and let others know some of what the contents contained.

265,"This book is a so-called ""classic,"" having been written in the late 1800's.  I have to say I was disappointed in it.  The characters are very one-dimensional.  Phoebe is good.  Hiram is  bad.  Phoebe's brother is  wishy-washy, and his wife is a witch.  I cannot understand why Phoebe sticks around being everyone's favorite doormat once she turns 18 and is legally released from her brother's guardianship.There were strong female protagonists created by other authors in the same time period, so the lack of complexity in Phoebe's character cannot be completely explained by time and place.  If you are interested in reading novels of this era, I highly recommend those written by Anna Katharine Green.  Green's characters are much more fully drawn, and the stories more satisfying.",Characters are one-dimensional

274,"The inspiration for this book was sweet, however, by the second half of the book, it was unclear if the story was about the experience of Jack's near boat catastrophe or about the lost opportunity for love.  The tone of the writing sharply changed also, to the point that it would be believable that someone else wrote the last half.  The ending was sweet, yet predictable.  The story could have used some more background on the marital relationship of the main character and the children's relationship with their father.  They seemed too accepting of Jack.  Would have expected some resentment from the eldest daughter who had been named after her mom's true love.",Two different styles

For such a short story, I was surprised at how well-developed & fleshed out the characters were along with the plot and storyline. I'm a sucker for second chance romances & this one did not disappoint. However, I would have loved for an epilogue, but the ending still left a smile on my face. With that said, I recommend Everything to Lose by Katie Reus for those looking for a sexy & fast romantic suspense to occupy their time.",Sometimes Less is More ;)

281,I probably would have given it four stars but there were a lot of grammatical and punctuation errors that at times made me stop and have to reread. I am not a grammar Nazi so that is saying something. The other thing was it started a little hard as he had to introduce a large cast. This story had a lot of thought put into it though so it was worth it. I enjoyed the twist on special zombie powers which I won't describe so I don't ruin it for others. All in all I have to say this was a pretty good book way above others in its genre.,Pretty good
282,This book was fairly well written. The pace was solid and I enjoyed the characters. Looking forward to reading the next book.,Solid story

284,"I found this vaguely depressing. If you don't mind uncomfortable settings (war) and circumstances (widowhood, capture & pursuit by the enemy) and relationships that seem destined to go nowhere (regrettable class barriers), then you might enjoy this. It started off nicely, but got steadily gloomier. At about 70%, I gave it up altogether - while it might have had a satisfying ending, by that point I was too discouraged to care.Other reviewers have commented on the similarities to Carla Kelly, but I was disappointed to find the wartime setting was the only thing the novels shared. I absolutely loved Carla Kelly's Marrying the Captain, Royal Marine and Surgeon series. They were gritty portrayals of war as secondary to the romance - yet the romances were heart-warming, uplifting and somehow full of hope. I don't mind angst and tension, but I must feel hopeful. I read for pleasure and this book just struck me as too gloomy. The hero and heroine seemed too willing to accept that they had no future together. Their relationship always focused on imminent separation, so they didn't fully enjoy the present.Just wasn't the book for me, I'm sorry to say. I'm sorry because I would have loved to have found another author who can offer such heartwarming stories as Kelly. The many excellent reviews of this book led me to expect a very different read, and I do hope if you buy this book you will have the experience others have had, and not what I found.",Vaguely Depressing

I really liked the story line and the idea for this book, but the writing was so annoying; too much description and too contrived for me.

287,"2.5 stars.I have a somewhat two-minded opinion about Force of Law.On one hand, it was a nice, light and entertaining enough read. A fun parody--even though trying too hard at times. Nothing heavy. Nothing that requires much attention/concentration. Nothing breath-taking and outstanding that will be remembered forever, but entertaining, nonetheless.On the other hand, it just was too much, at times--even though the book is intentionally cliched and over the top:Law is this alpha male of all alpha males. He's super talented, smart, intelligent, successful, powerful, dominant, rich, handsome, fearleass, brave, honourable, strong-minded. He's a billionaire. He's got the world laid out to his feet. Everyting he does or touches turns into gold. He might be a god..., he certainly feels and behaves like one. He's awfully arrogant or sure of himself--however you'd like to interpret it. When planning a picnic, he's using his helicopter or jet to get there, flying the thing himself, naturally. When confronted with a gun (while being unarmed himself) he fearlessly and single-handedly, and, of course, successfully--was there ever any doubt?--wrestles the gun-holding ""opponent"" for the gun, knocking him out easily while he's at it. And that's that. He joined the force and went to Afghanistan for no other reason than to kill Osama Bin Laden himself. While fighting bravely at the front for freedom and against terrorism, he's running his corporation via satellite (his private one, of course) and quite successfully so.In contrast to Law Tom--although being refered to as tough (why?)--can only be compared to a damsel in distress, helplessly waiting for the shining knight in armor to save the day or, which would be more appriopriate in Law's case, to save the world. I don't really like this kind of dynamic in a relationship, neither straight nor gay.And the rape-but-not-rape scene wasn't anything I liked very much, either. Tom was scared to death, waiting for the inevitable while trying to convince himself that it won't be all that bad, that it will be OK, and he just realizes that he's actually turned on as hell the second he feels Law's *** (or, to put it nice: member) up his virgin ***. That was too close for comfort. (A D/s [BDSM] dynamic is fine, even hot, but here it isn't. The thing between Law and Tom is not a D/s thing, not in that way.) I couldn't find anything remotely romantic in that.Yes, this book wants to be a parody, wants to be over the top. And it is working in some parts, but in others it isn't.Sometimes, less is more.","Sometimes, Less Is More. 2.5 Stars."

292,"I can't say as much as I'd like to without giving the entire story away. I didn't find the story to be ""cute"" in any way and there were no life lessons to be learned by the children. The entire story was very contrived. The author was trying to make things cute by having the children name the caterpillars things like ""Wormy"".

295,"This one was better than First Contact. It concentrated more on story than on just fighting. I have a gripe about Tesh-Dar. In this prequel series, we keep getting ""told"" how mighty Tesh-Dar is. I got tired of the repetition quickly. Fine, the author wants to change his mythos in these prequels. I guess that is his prerogative, but it just feels wrong if the reader still remembers the other three books. It undoes the logic and therefore the suspension of disbelief. Tesh-Dar can walk through walls, send herself through space, but can't get out from under a cave-in???? Even taking into account that she was 100 years older, in the first three books, it just doesn't feel like it makes sense anymore. I'm going to finish this series (I bought them), but I really feel like this is not a prequel series worthy of the first three books. I really wish that this prequel series had just been about Tesh-Dar's life. What brought her to the point of not killing Reza when she first found him?",Changed Mythos

299,"Reviewed by Francesca & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogI stumbled across this book yesterday, blurb sounded interesting and I know UTC loves Evangeline Anderson so I gave it a go while I went to get a pedicure.  Well.... I can probably sum up my review in this one sentence: I devoured this book!It's short but for the few hours you get to read it there's a lot of heavy breathing and your heart will definitely be through the roof.  It was kind of funny that at certain times I was checking to make sure nobody around me was looking at my tablet screen.  And then I couldn't put it down and had to sneak a few lines while I was driving.Duke and Maverick are roommates.  They are also in the soccer team together.  They are best friends and throughout the four years they've lived together they've become really close.  Except now they are about to get a whole lot closer.This story is told only from Mav's point of view and he's dealing with being attracted to Duke.  Duke doesn't make things easier as he is always being very close and physical and then there's the games of gay chicken...and extremely gay chicken.  When they are coming up short to pay their last month of rent they end up posing for some se xy pictures for the Str8te Boys website.  And things just escalate from there.This story was fun and sexy.  It's a story of discovery and of dealing with emotions and attraction.  But they both went for it and I was extremely glad for that!",I devoured this book!
300,This book is dark it has some romance but I would call it horror because that is the prevalent theme.  It is extremely long or at least it seemed that way since I can normally read one a day and this took 3 days to get done.  It was a good read and entertaining not top quality but showed a lot of promise and tons better than most books at this price.  It is worth your time to check this one out.,A good read but very Dark
301,"This was just the kind of story that I enjoy reading.  However, I did not enjoy reading this; it was too badly written.  The transitions were nonexistent.  At several points I was confused, and thought I had missed something.  It was as if parts of the story were missing.  Characters moved from one place to another with no explanation.  Simply lazy writing.  Was there no editor to offer advice to the author?  Didn't the author at least have a friend who could read it and point out what was missing?  I will never read anything by this author again, even if it's free.",Lazy writing

That amused me enough to click, and now here I am reading the thing, and it's actually not bad. It's a single recipe, but instead of this just being a one-pager, the author talks a bit about the history of porridge, what oats to use, etc. Not bad at all if you're a fan of the heated oat as a breakfast food. Will be trying this soon, replacing the hotbox with my oven. Aside from the missing information, which is annoying, this is quite a good little file to have around. **",Sounds worth trying...

I am not going to summarize the story because everyone has already done an excellent job of that.This was worth the download; I would have even bought it had the first in the series been the free one.  Just to continue the series - quick - easy reads.  I am starting on the third,Heat of the Storm: An Out of Uniform Story.now.These are the books in the series -Heat of the Moment: A Red-Hot Summer story.-  Seems to come before this book - since it is the story of Shelby Harper and John Garrett.

It could have easly been a whole story of friendship turn into a love story as it definitely had everything else to make it great all on its own. Elysia and Darien were really cute and I would have like to hear more about their friendship before the collapse.

308,Great suspense story! Kept me guessing till the end. No story like a classic by this author...great work. Really enjoyed it.,A good mystery
309,"What a basically ""blah"" story. Neither of the characters are especially interesting, the violence isn't at all effective (and of questionable reality in certain areas), there's no motivation for what's going on and basically just not much here to like.This story perpetuates one of the great myths of serial killers; that they love doing what they do and will snicker about how gloriously EVIL they are while doing it. We have two serial killers who like doing their thing through the medium of hitchhiking; one as a driver and the other as a passenger. When they meet up, it's like ""Frankenstein vs the Wolfman"", only even less interesting. I also find it vaguely amusing that the violence is quite graphic, but the sexual content is glossed over quickly, as per the usual for American audiences.There's some real potential here as a plot idea, but the execution, as it were, is terrible. I have no interest in reading anything by either of these authors and if I'd not downloaded the story for free, I'd feel quite ripped off.","Reads like bad internet fiction... oh, wait..."
310,"I loved the premise but, the story itself just dragged.  I was hooked in the beginning and then it just became a yawn",great premise
311,"I can't remember how I stumbled upon this book but I'm so glad I did! It was an interesting read and provided hours of entertainment via hanging on the edge of my seat! This book has a lot of action but it also has a great &#34;book worm&#34; factor with all of Abby's research. I really like how the author incorporated alot of truthful tidbits into the story, several of which I hadn't run across in the general knowlege base of Kennedy conspiracies. It wasn't a rehash and even though some of the action was a bit unbelivable and I had a hard time accepting some of the later characters like Rob and Demetrius, overall it was a very solid book with good strong lead characters. I think a few more sprinklings of &#34;the times&#34; would have made it more authentic- several of the later scenes in the college town felt too modern for me, seeing as how the story took place in the early 80s, but maybe that's just me! Pick it up- it's totally worth the $3!!",A solid read!
312,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story about Marc, the vampire Sire and Blake, his Childe and lets not forget the human, Kate.  Marc and Blake have been fighting demons but Blake seems to not see it as a responsibility but more as fun.  Marc is frustrated that Blake can't see that to protect the humans IS what's important, that humans are important.  When they meet Kate and her fellow human fighters while fighting a group of demons, they are taken back by Kate to the human compound, where they are greeted with not quite friendly faces.  Marc is intrigued by Kate, her boldness, her strength and by her beauty.  He knows it's not safe to get involved with a human and sees Blake's growing attraction to Kate as a threat to their very well being.  Kate is also torn by her attraction to both Marc and Blake.  She's distracted by them in the field which could prove deadly but she also knows they need Marc and Blake's help in fighting the demons.  Blake has some personal ""demons"" of his own to confront and deal with in his life as does Marc.  Secrets that both have that make their relationship difficult.  I'll not share any more but just say this is a wonderful story and I can't wait to read the next in the Blurred Trilogy.I received an eBook from the author for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: my view on this story is my own.","Wow,  great story and I can't wait to continue the journey!"
313,"This started off a little...haphazardly.  I wasn't sure of some of the phrasing and even had to read a line or two twice.  But the characters were very interesting, and the plot was quite intriguing.  The flow evened out perfectly and the first story was satisfying--I should have known, as is the case with a truly talented storyteller--this book would only get better.  Each story has its own flow--beginning, middle, end, and the book as a whole also has some great character growth. This isn't so much a collection of short stories as it is a set of adventures involving two (or more) great and funny characters.  There's wit, danger, intelligence--and most of all, Fun.  I loved it.",What a Delight

316,"There were a few things that I liked singularly in this story, especially the friend-to-lovers theme and the fact that Will, who is the quiet guy, had an unexpected dominant streak, but this fact was also what brought me out of the story a bit, because I see the book is tagged BDSM and I didn't really feel it as a theme of the book. There's also something that made me almost mad: Will's colleague is expecting him for dinner to set him up with her brother, he knows he has to go, but then he is caught up in his confrontation with Ethan and that fact is not mentioned anymore. I know one can't expect everything to be tied up, but what was the point? There was something good and intense in the story, but there was also something over-the-top and not deep enough. It's probably more 2.5*, but I liked Will a lot, so I'll bump it up a bit.",Not very convincing
317,This series was the first one that sucked me into vampires and the reading world in general. I picked up Wings in the Night and just could NOT put it down.

You won't be disappointed! :),Incredible DEAL and AWESOME Series!
318,"Just finished reading this book on my Kindle....Sounded promising from the cover but lets face it, this is no Diana Gabaldon...Unfortunately, this is a dull dull book, poorly written, no back bone, full of grammar, puntuation, orthograph mistakes. Very difficult to follow any kind of timeline or conversation between caracters for that matter and it does not improve as you read along. This book is a first draft that has never been edited by anyone but was published anyway. It is a sad story and it is pityful. This is my first bad review and I am sorry for it but it is not worth the $0.97 I paid for it.",Oh Boy! what a nightmare!
319,"I was attracted to this book because of the idea. I thought that it had so much potential!!! I liked the story, but the one thing I have found by reading a few titles from these authors is that they seem to be more interested in being shocking and controversial, than they are in making a full-bodied story. You could sort of feel the shift in excitement when they had the opportunity to write something really vile.I am a fan of horror and gore, but not just for its own sake. Seemed like they wanted to write some sick, twisted scenes and needed to put a book around them to make them ""respectable"". Not a bad read, but not great. Just pretty good.",Great idea!

I did pick up that the MC's best friend was centaur. It was an okay read. I am going to find the sext in the series to continue the story.",Quick read
324,"I was expecting a lot more...kinky, to be honest. The publisher's description says Lynda likes ""Wild sex. Naughty sex. Kinky sex,"" but the extent of the wildness and kinkiness was a paragraph or two involving the very light use of a whip, and an f/f/m encounter.Having said that, the sex that is in the book, though it doesn't live up to my expectation based on the synopsis of the book, is still very good. It's detailed, passionate, realistic and steamy.What let the book down for me, was the fact that not much is going on in between the sex scenes. There's a lot of narrative, and not much dialogue.This book is a lot better and a lot longer than some of the other Ellora's Cave books I've read, so don't let that name put you off reading this.","Pretty good, but not very kinky"

337,"Brody, formerly a special ops officer in the Marine Corp, is a 30-something Renaissance Literature professor with a thing for one of the students who just completed this semester's class.  Missy is 26 and working her way through college with dreams of going to medical school.  One night, when her crush, Professor Brody, comes into the adult store where Missy works, a little chit chat leads Brody to volunteer to teach Missy to play poker.  When a few friendly lessons in cards turn into lessons in the bedroom, Missy's inhibitions about her weight threaten to crush their relationship.  Can Brody convince Missy to up the ante and turn this two of a kind into a full house or will Missy fold instead?Do you remember those first few romance novels you read?  If you were at all like me, you snatched them from your mother (or aunt) and alternately grinned and giggled through them.  Part of it was because of the intimacy of the subject matter (even if the books were sedate compared to what you read today) and part of it was reading something maybe you shouldn't have been.  That's exactly what this book was like for me - I found myself grinning and giggling like a happy fool throughout the story.For me, this book had it all... a slightly dangerous, slightly possessive, handsy hero, a mouthy but shy-about-her-weight heroine, a whole lot of sexy banter, sweet but hot monkey love, and a couple of girlfriends (from previous books) that are supportive and maybe a little crazy.  I loved that Brody and Missy have a good time together, whether they're fooling around, fighting, or just having a simple conversation.  Brody is a little unreasonable sometimes, but Missy doesn't just let him run her over - she pushes back.  The back and forth repartee between Brody and his brother is funny and demonstrates their good relationship.Missy is somewhere around a size 16/18 (according to Brody's estimation, though a definitive size is never given for her).  As a result of the encouragement and self-confidence that Brody and her friends help to build up, Missy undergoes a bit of a physical transformation.  I can't explain, as a plus-sized woman, how thrilled I was to watch her change without having to lose weight and to see how well-received it was by her circle of friends.  So many stories about curvy heroines require that she loses weight to finally get the attention/love of the hero.  I was so pleased that Brody helped her to reveal this hidden part of herself while her curves remained unchanged.Since this book is listed as erotica, the story is explicit, but it's the parts outside of the proverbial bedroom that made this book so great to me.  When writing a story, an author can develop characters by telling you what they are like or by showing you.  For example, suppose you have a character that readers should believe is dangerous.  With ""telling"", the author has narrative in the story that basically says the Hero is dangerous - he used to be a Marine, he knows how to fight, etc.  With showing, there's a fight and the Hero takes on five armed men while he only has a broken pool stick.  With ""showing"", you get to experience and see for yourself that the character is who the author wants you to think they are.  It's much easier to tell readers about the hero/heroine, especially in erotica where so many authors think the storyline is just about the sex.  With this story, however, there's a magical balance of telling and showing.  We know Brody wants Missy, but then we get to see it.  He constantly touches her when they're together, he can scan a crowd to find her, he likes to hold her hand, he encourages her to be sexually open with him because he loves her body as is, etc.I've read several of Lena Matthews' books in the past and they're always well written with creative but still sweet love scenes.  This story was probably my favorite of her books and a fantastic value for the current (Kindle) price.  The story is probably a 3 to 4 hour read.  Highly recommended.",A Royal Flush

I don't think I made it past five chapters before giving up. The main character is completely stupid. Why go running in the forest you know has demons in it and then when you meet the demon what do you do? Make out with him. Yea so believable. Not to much the writer writes like she has adhd.

352,"How awful is this unfocused collection of words? Let me count the ways:1. There is no plot (that should be enough, but there's more).2. The heroine (for lack of a better word) is a paranoid, shallow mass of nothingness. We don't know if she could have had any more depth because the author provided absolutely no worthwhile character development. In fact, what little information the reader is given about her made her very unattractive. She is materialistic, narcissistic and moody for no clear reason. The very first page clumsily recalls how she picks a fight with her husband over absolutely nothing.Sadly, the pitiful introduction to her hair is the entire basis of the book, although the synopsis held so much promise. The husband is just there so the story can have a male counterpart; he is quite insignificant. If he mentions it once, he mentions it a thousand times that he wants to get to know his wife of seven years. What?!?3. Why does this author (for lack of a better word) make them have their only serious conversations right in the middle of the awful sex scenes, not once but several times? Weird. Other than that, there is no meaningful dialogue between the two of them.4. Some of the informational points are repeated, over and over, and over again. Why?5. If this is an IR romance, why was race in regards to their relationship never highlighted?6. Did I mention there is no plot?So, yes, this was an awful read and I now know to avoid this author. That is a shame because she has so many books available, which is incredible considering the lack of quality in her storytelling.Had I gotten this book for free, I would have paid too much.",This atrocity is an insult.

354,"I like books with sports heroes, but this story's hero came across  more like a businessman than a wealthy rugby player as there was very little about rugby in the story. The heroine was an aroma therapist and masseuse struggling to pay her bills and work at home. The house is falling down around her. There is a mystery. The heroine is caring for her dead sister's 9 year old child (father unknown) and the hero is accused of being the father  by the paparazzi. The hero and heroine work together trying to solve the mystery while the heroine's business is vandalized and she fears for her life. Of course she has to move in with the hero. The mystery is easily solved by the reader ahead of the end of the story. The romance and the chemistry between the hero and heroine is flat. Even the sex scenes, are not very interesting and I found myself skipping ahead. I just didn't feel a connection with the hero and heroine. While the story isn't really bad, it is missing the necessary emotion in a romance. For that reason, I can't rate it higher.",Not Quite A Winner

356,"Things are looking up for Caesar Romano. The opening party for the new show at the gallery where he works is looking to be a huge success. With that under his belt, he can quit his low-paying job and apply for a much better paying job at a much more prestigious gallery uptown. The only fly in the ointment is the presence of his former boyfriend Shep, a closeted actor who can&#8217;t seem to stay away. On the plus side, there&#8217;s a hunky though apparently straight detective on the scene who seems more than a little interested in Caesar.The picture isn&#8217;t quite as rosy the next morning, when Caesar arrives at the gallery to find Shep passed out, naked, in the bathroom, and one of the centerpiece busts from the show missing. The stolen artwork is just the tip of the iceberg, as Caesar and his friends are drawn into a web of strange alliances and blackmail. Along the way he finds out that Detective Dan isn&#8217;t what he seems.&#8220;Catch Me If You Can&#8221; is a rather pleasant mystery story. There&#8217;s a bit of screwball comedy to the story line, which could have been played up more. The humor definitely comes through, but doesn&#8217;t quite hit the mark. The same could be said for the mystery itself. It didn&#8217;t quite gel, at least for me. Somewhat curiously, the issue here is that there&#8217;s a little too much going on. That&#8217;s usually not a problem for mysteries, but in this case there are a lot of scenes that actually pull you away from the plot to deliver a political or social commentary, which often buries clues and leads to the mystery.On the plus side, the two main characters have great chemistry together. It&#8217;s not all sweetness and mushy romance; these two have to work a bit to make a real connection. Caesar and Dan are surrounded by a large cast of equally well-drawn characters. The characters alone make this an above average read, and with a tighter plot it would have been even better. I would actually give it 3.5 stars.",Pleasant story that doesn't quite hit the mark

361,"Patterson, author ofThe Craigslist Killer (A Digital Short), has turned in another uneven short story with ""19.""Misleadingly described as a medical thriller (just because a character suffers health problems doesn't mean the resulting story will appeal to readers of that genre), this story suffers from a meandering plot, unresolved details, and awkward framing.A man (nearing the end of his life?  We're just told his grey hair indicates he is older than fifty) receives a letter from an old flame.  They were actually engaged at one point, but the engagement ended.  Why?  We're told he never knew why.Okay.  Maybe those questions will be answered in the manuscript that his ex encloses.Nope.  It's a totally different story, starting at her childhood and then skipping forward to middle-age.  There's a little too much detail at the beginning (for example:  her material grandparents didn't want her parents to get married, telling her to stay away from ""Polls"" [sic]), as if Patterson initially set out to write a longer story and then lost his resolve.  So after setting the scene, we're skipped ahead decades.The plot itself, we're told, is based on a true story.  It's one of those things that you might hear of happening to a friend of a friend of a friend -- a woman smells roses if somebody in her family is about to die.  But this wasn't enough and we get two other supernatural elements that are played out in great detail and then never explained.It's less thrilling than it is sophoric.  The reader keeps waiting for details to be explained or come together to create a cohesive whole, but it never happens.",Uneven

I found at least a couple of sentence errors in each chapter to the tune of missed words or incorrect words--these are the type of errors that make you re-read the sentence three time to figure it out or force you to give up.The book doesn't just need copy editing. There are a lot of inconsistencies too. Eight years or 15 years? He died before this event or after this event?Also, there were too many common and repeatedly used names.

376,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.",Great Collection of Fairy Tales

But for me, I think basing this book on the Disney story of beauty and the beast was a bit juvenile. As were parts of the story. Things came to a head much too quickly for it to have been believable and the heroine going from, &#34;I hate this guy&#34; to &#34;well, I guess I can give him a chance&#34; was too much for me to take in. Overall, I thought this book was corny beyond belief and makes me wonder if other books the author has written as like this one.

381,"I totally enjoyed this story!  I get a little frustrated with all the comments about editing during reviews, maybe we should start critiquing the art work on the cover next.  The reason I read reviews is to see if the novel will be interesting to read.  We are all very fortunate these days to have the excitement of e-books and indie authors.  This means that we get the freshness of new authors, some of them so determined to get their story out that they will type it out on a phone.  That is just so cool to me.  Big deal, there are a few typos, a few misspelled words,  (probably from auto editing, which I love to hate) but the main thing is the STORY!  This is a good one, I would probably give this book 5 stars, except it reviewed for 3 when I read it, and the next book in this trilogy is rated a 4.5, the third a 5, I want to have some where to go.  Times like these I wish there were 10 stars to review with.The story was fantastic, the characters were great, and the plot was very creative.  This is a really enjoyable book.  I don't really get why some people rated it so low.  What is not to like?  The main character is a nice likeable guy,  and the rest of his crew are good people too.  The bad guys, well some are truely bad, there are some not as bad, bad guys too. The plot can seem pretty simple at first, but like all good books, the plot swells & grows as time passes.

388,"I picked this book up for free quite some time ago, and finally had the time and the urge to read it. It's professional in presentation, and I found few errors, so I was impressed with that. I'm not thrilled with the cover art, but that is more a matter of taste than any failing on quality. This book would look good next to a big six book on the shelf. It's worth paying for, and I'm shocked to see that it is still available for free. So is the sequel. Wow.First of all, be prepared for a long read. Granted this isn't a 1,000 page monstrosity like some fantasy books that come out, but it is well over 600 pages, so it's a healthy read. Personally, I would have broken it into two books. At 52% a major plot line resolves, and while the overall &#34;evil&#34; is still around, the book could have easily finished up at this point, and the rest of the overarching plot could have been resolved in a second book.There's quite a lot of decent action, and the bad guys are suitably bad. I think the good guys could have been a bit more competent, or at least have more than one or two people who could actually do anything. I realize we want the heroes to appear properly heroic, but I felt at time that the population was so lacking that they almost deserved to get slaughtered. The trials that the main hero and heroine undergo are impressively trying though, so that was nice.I'd actually call this a 3.5 star rating. It's good enough that I will be reading the sequel, but as it is also over 600 pages, it will have to wait until I'm up for something that long.",Bad Guys Shine in Their Villainy

The first book was OK, the writing wasn't great but the story made it worth the continued read. This one, oh dear god. Raea spends the entire book vacillating between rhapsodising about Elis' eyes, hair, touch, smell etc, and having debates in her head about who is/may be/probably double crossing her. Elis spends the whole time, literally, in tears. It went something like this. This reminds me of Elis, oh I miss him, oh if only I had paid attention, oh I can't wait to feel his arms around me, oh if only I could have realised earlier that I love him. Rinse repeat. Over and over and over and....you get the point. And that wasn't the only bit of repetition, we get told the same exact thing again and again, seriously, I counted at least four places where the same paragraph imparts the same information, almost verbatim. And what is with this girl and slapping people in the face? She's a little slap happy. The only interesting thing about this book was that it introduced us to Inar'Ahben but only in the most basic sense. Quite a horrid little exercise in frustration this one, I suggest you move along as there's very little to see here.",What. The. Hell?!
392,"I have been reading Ms. Dohner's books for several years, and have usually been able to like her female characters, but not Mika. She acts like a baby and whines through the whole story. She's a human adopted by a werewolf mother and human father. Her Uncle Omar, a were enforcer, loves her to death. She visits him each year for 2 weeks. This year she comes in the middle of mating heat for the weres. After she is almost gang raped by 4 weres, she is rescued by her equally shallow hero, Grady. Instead of Shannon being responsible for her own safety and well-being, she constantly whines about not knowing what is going on. Hey, ask Uncle Omar or at least pretend to listen to Aunt Minnie, Omar's girl friend, when she tries to explain everything to you! Please!!! And, as for Grady, it's mating heat time, so you know what he cares about! Even he whines the only time Mika takes a stand for herself-&#34;I want things like they were before,&#34; meaning a willing bed partner with no regard for anything else. Hey, and he won't &#34;mate&#34; with her so what's the big deal? Instead of the tension between the characters moving the story forward, it just became tedious. Even the over the top, let's have sex every time the reader turns the page became boring. I skipped most of the last half of the book. So, why did I finish it? I kept hoping that Ms. Dohner would finally make the characters more appealing. Sadly, that did not happen. My advice, skip this book in the series and move on to the second book, His Purrfect Mate.

397,"This book was too depressing and didn't feel like a romance novel. Before I scare you away, let me assure you that it has a HEA so this is technically a romance. Unfortunately, I didn't get it.Detective Inspector James McBride's life is a mess and he doesn't know how to fix it. He's forty years old, divorced and not quite at peace with his sexuality. On the professional front, things don't look good either: his current undercover assignment has him pretending to be an alcoholic and gambling addict in order to infiltrate and bust a human-trafficking ring, but not all the drinking he's been doing lately is exactly necessary to do his job. Needless to say, he ends up blowing his cover and is taken off the case.Reassigned to look after the visiting Israeli ambassador, which is a constable's job and thus unworthy of his rank, McBride feels an instant connection with Tobias Leitner, the leader of the Israeli security team. McBride should know better than to get involved with Toby, who's still recovering from the death of his partner and lover, but fate, in the form of an unexpected brush with death and the kidnapping of McBride's daughter Gracie, conspires to get them together. Can they rescue Gracie, defeat the bad guys, survive to tell the story, and heal one another's heart in the process?Phew, this was not a light read! The story had a dark tone and none of the characters was particularly nice. I didn't like McBride, I didn't get to know Toby well enough to either like or dislike him, and as a result, I didn't care about their relationship. I liked the action scenes, but I don't read romances for them.The plot was too complex to fit the constraints of a novella, and that affected the development of McBride and Toby's romance. In fact, I felt that the focus of the story was McBride's downfall and recovery, and his relationship with Toby was just an afterthought. If I had to classify this book following the rules I know, I'd have to create a new genre: women's fiction with a male character as protagonist. As I'm not a fan of women's fiction and having a man as protagonist makes no difference to me, this book failed to grab me.",Not enough romance...

402,"I didn't enjoy this one. If I can be honest, I don't enjoy the writing style as much as book 1. I like the narrator's voice, but considering this book was written in a four person POV, the narrator didn't even bother trying to differentiate the voices. I ended up rewinding a few times to see who was talking since it featured Zach & Angelo and Matt & Jared. My enjoyment of this series really plummeted with this book.This book started with Zach giving Angelo a free pass to be with another man, with the agreement that Angelo come home to him afterwards. Considering how hard they fought to be together 4 months ago, I was surprised that Angelo would quickly jump at the opportunities.The main problem that I had was that Angelo throws a conniption fit if someone looks sideways at Zach. It just seems hypocritical, and I was unsure of Zach's true motivations for allowing the free pass. If I really got why, I might have been able to accept it more.I completely with Jonathan's assessment that it would appear that they had an open relationship, but it only works one way. I mean, Angelo is getting a handjob on a public dancefloor in front of Zach, but Angelo attacks Jonathan for kissing Zach. Can you say hypocrite?I don't think Jonathan owed Angelo an apology, maybe an explanation but Angelo didn't even have the decency to offer  Jonathan an apology and explanation back. Angelo was just a taker and Zach a doormat in this book, and I didn't like it at all.Jared and Matt have been together for a little over a year, but Matt talked about how going all the way felt wrong. I am confused. In the prior books it seemed like they couldn't get enough, but Matt explains they do &#34;other stuff&#34;. I want to know if Matt is really gay because his feeling of guilt or that it doesn't &#34;feel right&#34; should concern Jared.I just don't get these relationships. I know everyone has what works for them, but right now, neither couple's interactions are working for me.  I will try one more book in this series before I give it up.","2.5 stars.

403,"Overall this is a fun story.  It starts a little slow but gets interesting fairly quickly.  It opens with Josh and Ryan meeting, getting nasty and going their separate ways.  With the introduction of paparazzi photos of their indiscretion, the actual story takes off.  There are hidden cameramen, family harassment, stress, arguments and fights to get the ball rolling.  And, once it got going, it was pretty fun.Before the book's climax, it wasn't too difficult to sort out who was behind the photo stalking - although to be honest I was only half right...There are a few sub-plot elements that didn't seem necessary such as including Josh's ex-brother-in-law, but they weren't so prevalent as to get in the way.",Tabloid Star

So I'm not sure if I will read one of his novels or not, depends, but I probably won't be looking for one, if it pops up on the radar screen, them yes, if not, then no.",story is good...

416,"This was a great follow up to King of Prey. The main character in this is the right hand man of the King of Hawks. Sachin meets his mate when she is to young to claim but he continues to visit her as she grows up. After mistakes are made and trust is lost Sachin must figure out what he wants and how to hang on to it.I liked how this book went with a different approach to how the main characters meet and their relationship progresses. There was no instant love with them flying off into the sunset. It was a more real love with a undeniable passion between the two that is common in the paranormal romances. I enjoyed following both characters and learning about them, their pasts and their futures.Again I love this series and so far out of all the books this one was my favorite. I definitely recommend this to fans of Paranormal Romance or shifter stories.*I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review.*",Unique bird shifter series
417,"Reading the description of this book, I felt it had great promise, but unfortunately it fell flat. There was so much that could have been done better, so much more I would have loved to have known about the unique situation the heroine found herself in. The cheesy, campy language of the heros made this story anything but erotic romance. Way too many ""yehaws"" and ""wooweees"" made the book more ridiculous than anything else. I honestly can't recommend this book to anyone. The only reason it got 2 stars from me was because there were very few typos and editorial mistakes than in other books I've read.",Had promise

421,"I really enjoyed Biting Nixie, also by Mary Hughes. Laugh out loud funny, it had appealing characters and a sexy romance. While sometimes silly, she managed to balance it with a quick moving, interesting storyline. Disappointingly, that was not the case with the follow up novel Biting Me Softly. This book did not hold my interest and after putting it down to read some other books, I had to force myself to go back and finish it. While it was frequently funny, it crossed over to being annoyingly silly at times--the 'good Liese' and 'bad Liese' voices for example. I also didn't buy the romance. There wasn't enough development of the relationship nor did I see why Logan would fall for Liese. There also wasn't a well developed storyline to offset the silliness and lackluster romance. All in all, it was not one of the better paranormal romances.If you want to try this author, I really did like Biting Nixie so give that one a try. If you are looking for humorous, light paranormal romances, check out Shelly Laurenston's Pride Stories, Lynsay Sands' Argeneau series, Erin McCarthy's Vegas Vampires, Kerrelyn Sparks' Love at Stake, and Katie MacAllister's Aisley Grey Guardian series.","Funny read, but relationship development fell short"
422,"Our favorite gay medium, Vic Bayne, returns in the 2nd installment of the Psycop series. Unwilling to go back to his apartment where the incubus almost killed him and was turned into a mass of protoplasm (""Among the Living"", the first novel), Jacob has moved in with Vic and both are testing the waters of cohabitation. In each character's mind, they realize this may or may not be temporary as neither has broached the subject of actually living together. Vic's friend Lisa is now in training at PsyTrain, and he has been assigned a new partner, Roger Burke, a rather affable eager-to-please who accepts Vic and his sexuality all in stride. This all seems well enough, and things should be going well for Vic, except that his psychic ability has gone into hyperactive mode. The dead are now clearly visible everywhere, and they seek him out when he's around. Constantly reaching for him, he can actually physically feel them and starts to lose control and break down.It's a very enjoyable story. Vic is a wonderfully complex character, and his sarcastic wit gives the story a lighter edge when needed. As with any good story, Vic undergoes some growth, which adds to the empathy one can feel for him. Too many serial stories don't let their characters grow, trying to keep them the same as they were in the first book, so it's pleasant when you can see and chart the growth Vic is gradually going through. Other characters aren't quite as fleshed out as Vic is, but they're still interesting and enjoyable. The story stumbles a little at times by stretching plausibility (like the introduction of a device that lets Vic tune in or tune out spirits, which raises more questions as to the nature of the spirits than it answers), but overall, it's an immensely interesting and enjoyable novel.",Don't cross this one off your list
423,"This is an absolutely awesome buy if you're interested in starting the Steele series. Loved all the stories in this book including the first short story of Dane and Sienna. Loved all the Steele brothers and cousin Vanessa' stories. Chance and Kylie had a sweet and very funny coming together. Lots of mischief. Sebastian(Bas) and Jocelyn had a feisty and rocky road to travel. Also in that story was the very touching and loving story between Jocelyn's sister Leah and Reese the man she loved but left behind without a word. Then you have Morgan who finally found Lena Spears, his perfect woman, even if she doesn't agree with him. Can't not love a beautiful man that loves your family too. Last but not least Vanessa and sworn enemy, the delicious Cameron Cody, who like Morgan has wanted his woman from a far for too long and is tired of waiting. Taking matters into his own hands, he lays out a proposition she can't, and deep down doesn't want to refuse.

425,"Angel's Pawn is a stand alone novella that introduces us to Ashwini, who works for The Guild and Janvier, a vampire she's constantly tracking. Even though you don't have to have read Angels' Blood and Archangel's Kiss before reading the novella, I would suggest you do so. If you're not familiar with The Guild, you will be confused. A lot of character names are introduced in this novella and even I had a hard time keeping them straight. Being a novella, it was a quick read. I enjoyed the sexual tension between Ash and Janvier. They bantered constantly which kept the pace of the novella moving steadily. This was a quick way for me to get my Guild Hunter fix even though Raphael and Elena are not mentioned in the novella. I enjoyed Ash and Janvier's relationship immensely. I finished reading Angels' Pawn feeling unfilled. There was no resolution in regards to their ""relationship"". Janvier has the hots for Ash but Ash has a steadfast rule of not dating vampires. But throughout the novella, Ash struggled against giving in to Janvier's cajun charm.

431,"At the time that I write this review, there are currently 14 other reviews all with 5 stars.  I am giving this 3 stars because I didn't find anything truly outstanding about this book.Most of the stort stories are in a first-person point-of-view, as told by Adam.  However, there are a few that are not and I found that confusing.  Also, there is one story (Michigan) in which the narrator refers to himself as Noah.  Who is Noah?  Later in another story, when Adam speaks of losing his grandmother, I can only assume that it was Adam at the hosptial/nursing home.  Why he said his name was Noah, I still do not know.The final issue I have with the book is that some of the sentences I had to read over and over again.  They were phrased so strangely that they barely made sense.  I could have though of many other ways to have written those sentences and I am by no means a writer.The collection of stories all and all were good, not great.  The bottomline is: I wasn't hooked and I did not feel the urge to read every chance I got, as I do with REALLY good books.",I'm in the minority...

Ms. Bell's realistic take on the lives and loves of these characters grabbed at my heart and I loved each and every one of them.

She is a vigilante who wants answers but chooses to just kill any that are like the creature that killed her family.I would have liked it to be longer, only because there was so much left unsaid.  I would have liked to read about the past, about the murders and how she turned herself into a vampire hunter, and what happens next.  But that being said, it was decently written and I enjoyed it.

They had been making love, and for the first time, she gave him the full Monty, mind to mind. He didn't let the doorknob hit him on the ass as he raced away.Now Sera's back, having learned to better control her powers, Jake has done a little growing up and research. A freak snowstorm traps them together, and provides the excuse that of course Sera has to take off all of Jake's clothes, and her own, to warm him up and save his life.

450,"I know it's by a classic author & I feel I should join the positive reviewers here, but I'm afraid I can't.The book starts well enough, with a daring prisoner-of-war camp escape, by balloon, followed be a harrowing flight through the storm & a forced landing on a Pacific Island. Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.",Handyman's Journal

She is constantly mixing up the use of him/himself, she/herself, he/him, she/her, and I/me.It is like hitting a brick wall when this happens, taking the reader completely out of the flow of what is otherwise a pretty decent book.I'd advise she either get an editor with a grammatical background or some grammar lessons.",Grammar mistakes interrupt the flow and bring down its enjoyment factor
452,"Dealing with testy moral issues like assisted dying and euthanasia is never easy - but the story weaves these together with compelling arguments for and against in the guise of a tale that begins with a Grandmother's letter to her dropout net-surfing journalist-wannabe grandson and pits him with (initially) and then against his new romance; a human rights activist who turns out to be the very kind of person that the inventors of the Death Trip want to be rid off.Dealing with how society sees the burden of care being paid for and dealt with - our main character Chuck is torn between blowing the story of the big evil Pharmaceutical Company that wants to euthanise the undesirables and prove the activist right, or believe the softly insidious entreaties of the idea behind the science and the advances of the owner's daughter, with whom he has a torrid affair.A good story that walks the line between the issues well but does have an almost deliberately rushed ending, as if a Sequel was the obvious answer - I would still definitely recommend the Author.",Thoughtful and entertaining

459,"Lets begin by saying I am a fan of this supernatural genre but this book was very disappointing. It suffers from an extreme identity crisis. Is it a supernatural story, a thriller, a comedy, a romance, a family melodrama, a cheesy graphic erotic novel or all six? At times it seemed like it had 4 writers. A better writer may have combines all that but that was not the case, the plot was messy and the end has so many silly twists and turns it gave the reader whiplash. The characters were stereotypes and barely two dimensional. The Benji character was particularly annoying with all his gay sterotypical comments. Even the most flaming gay man talks normally sometimes. I give this 2 stars based on the idea but without better execution ( and writing ) I am positive this series will be a big dud.",Suffers from Identity Crisis
460,"(May contain spoilers)The book starts out solid and interesting. Then in the middle everything shifts and explodes into a bad plot twist. When I read the summary and it mentioned gods I figured it would be figurative, however they were not. This author put flat out religious, ridiculous, prophetic god characters into what began as a solid space apocalypse plot. It's just way too much.To have the apocalypse happen in a dystopian future while also throwing in some space tech walks a fine line between a great story plot and having too much going on. The author was doing quite well until deciding it was time to throw the whole thing off a cliff, kill off a bunch of characters, add an unconvincing romance, and let loose a ""twist"" in the form of gods who are suddenly the reason behind the apocalypse. Additionally the main character goes from being a fairly strong female character who holds no belief in religion to bring a forlorn, love struck, weakling who laments death and embraces the ""goddess"" that claims her. Nonsense.The only reason this gets two stars is because the first half of the book was a solid story. Before it went off to crazy land I was intrigued and excited to finish the book. The ""teaser chapter"" at the end of the book promises that the next book will be even worse than the last half of this one, so I won't even bother. Sad to see such a promising plot get blown up in the efforts of an author to reach beyond the limits of their plot line. At least there weren't any zombies, cause then it would have just been a straight up joke.","Great start, then it sucks..."
461,"Here we have a great premise for a series, with the retired schoolteacher and the small-town cop banding together to solve mysteries, and I appreciated the picture-postcard Maine setting as well. However, I think the book shows its roots as a first novel----it isn't badly written, but could use a little more polish. (And really, an editor should have told the author to remove just about every exclamation point from this manuscript---as a rule, I would say that novels simply shouldn't contain too many exclamation points---practically NONE, in fact, unless they're used in dialogue.)Now, this is a solid mystery, and not a romance---no love scenes here. And that's fine---however, I think a definite shortcoming of the book was the lack of ALL emotional content. It's as if the author is uncomfortable with writing about relationships. I've read other gay-themed mysteries that focus on a decent whodunnit while also delving into the private life of the main characters, and they've been quite satisfying. The complete lack of detail regarding the relationship between Jesse and Tim in this book is rather off-putting, actually, and difficult to understand.It's a great set-up for some decent drama---here you have two old school acquaintances getting to know one another again after thirty-five years. But the way the book handles their initial hook-up is baffling: Tim comes over to dinner at Jesse's place one evening, without Jesse even knowing Tim is gay---and then there's a jump-cut to the next morning with Tim coming out of Jesse's shower, and apparently they're now a couple. What the heck??! This would have been a great opportunity for a long dialogue scene which could have been played in any number of different ways. No, I'm not asking for a sex scene---but I would like to know how these two ended up together, what they said to one another---there is NOTHING in the text to indicate how this played out.Likewise, a little later in the plot Tim's eighteen-year-old daughter comes home from visiting her mother and finds Jesse at Tim's place. Suddenly she not only finds out her father is gay, but that he's actively involved with another man----great opportunity for drama, no? Well---apparently not---because once again this is never explored---we never do get to know what happens, how she reacts.So for me this is a problem---I'm not asking for the novel to turn into a torrid romance, and I have no problem at all about there being zero explicit content. But I would like to know a little more about the relationship of the protagonists, how it develops and plays out; I'd like a little more emotional content in the book, in addition to the mystery. So, as such I wasn't really satisfied with this in the end, and I'm giving it a mixed review.This is the first of several mysteries in a series, and I am curious to know what happens next---and if the author's writing style shows any development. But, I'm not sure whether I want to continue if the other books also ignore the relationship as thoroughly as this one did.",Great premise with problematic execution

Kudos to this author for making me fall in love with the characters over and over again throughout the book. Even the ones I hated, I loved! That's how beautifully written they were.

466,This book was ok but to be honest for me there was too much sex in relation to the story. I like sex and kink but it has to fit in with the story and this I felt was sex heavy.,"A whole lot of sex, little story"
467,"Just like several other reviewers of this book, I had to walk away from reading it several times before I could get it all down.  (And I have a seriously strong stomach for violence.)  This is rape.  There's no other word for it.  I've recently started reading BDSM books after never having gone beyond so-called ""bodice-rippers"" in my 63 years.  Flat-out rape is a legitimate plot device, but I find the conversion of the victim into a willing wife to be offensive. She fell into the hands of a predatory stalker, and she got gang-raped by him and his employees.  To have her then succumb to his manly wiles just makes her look stupid, on top of that.  I had thought better of the author.  I read Harlequin novels in 1976 where the ""heroine"" fell in love with her rapist and married him, but generally, those were written for very stupid women.Apparently times have not progressed much.  I've read a number of BDSM books lately where the characters are interesting and well-written, and where they make rational decisions based upon the actions in the stories.  Once she stopped biting the head rapist here, I stopped believing this story.I also second the mention in another review that the description of the device they built to hold her was inadequate.  Readers are not incapable of visualizing a device, if the description is clear.  In this case, it was appallingly unclear.  The author might as well have just said that they were using magic wands to hold her and move her around.  Additionally, I was greatly concerned with the eventual use to which the pictures of her were to be put.  It is all well and good to say that the five rapists ""love her"", but the pictures they took and posted on the wall of screens could both be used to destroy her career, and to send them to prison for years, had she chosen to be litigious, as she should have.  It kept distracting me from the story, every time that wall of screens was mentioned.  (What can I say?  I used to work in a law school.)The author is an intelligent woman.  She writes well, and she spells well, and she punctuates well.  Her prose is clear (although not her description of that device).  I gave her an extra star for having paid attention in English class.  And at two stars for content, I was being generous.  Rape is appalling, but understandable.  Falling in love with the rapists, all five of them, is not.  The other reviewers have mentioned the victim's deeply-hidden desire to be loved, and her Daddy issues.  More cliches.  Rape is rape.",The premise is very disturbing
468,It could have been so much better. It seemed thrown together. To have started with such a fantastic idea the story consisted of nothing but gore and predictability. It would be stretching it to call this the very bare skeleton of a great book. The whole thing was much too rushed and unbelievable.,thrown together
469,"This book does not state it is part of a series, but it follows &#34;Hired by a cowboy&#34;  Both books were very nice reads! I will continue to read other books by this author",Loved it
470,"This is a really tough review to write.  I actually came on Amazon when I finished the story, to see if there was a sequel.  I really hoped some of the loose ends might be tied up somewhere.  And, I actually liked the last third of the book, even though the sex was disappointing!  I really wanted to know more about the characters...except ""Bella"".  I love strong, capable female characters, but she was only good on a bike and with weapons.  I did not understand Jack's undying love, as I thought she had all the appeal of a wet marshmallow.  She was such a hot mess, under  that tough exterior, that I almost quit reading.  And the constant, never ending misuse of ""phase"" for ""faze"" was incredibly irritating. I'm not a grammar freak, typos don't faze me...but this constant usage of phase, or phased, was seriously starting to bother me. I would expect someone who wrote this many books to know the difference.  And every hot guy looks, and sounds, like a movie star?  Seriously?  Bella kind of redeemed herself at the end, enough that I would have bought a sequel had it been available.  I can't imagine ever re-reading this though...All in all, not the worst book I've ever read, but certainly not the best.  I am a little surprised by so many five star reviews.  Even with the parts I disliked, I might have given it a four, if I hadn't felt like I was just left hanging.",Hell Bent?
471,"The truth is that I have not noticed this was Harlequin romance at the time of downloading. I usualy do not read romance books but since it already was on my kindle I decided to give it a try during my vacation. Well - I did finished it since it was quite a quick read. I never realy grew to like the main characters though. The female character Lorna was weak and strange while the male character James was so perfect that he sounded out of this world unbelivable. Anyway, this was an interesting experience for me.",Harlequin Romance

Not broken, the material inside the strap had dissolved into a black mush.  This is a material design defect.  The Kindle 2, c/w cover, hasn't been exposed to any environment that would initiate this type of failure.",Watch out.. Cover is good but the elastic strap disolves
474,The book is okay.  What you think of it depends on what you like to read and that has something to do with personality.

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone.",Aww...so sweet.

480,"I TOTALLY AGREE WITH ""LADY RAVEN"" EACH REVIEWER IS ENTITLED TO HIS OR HER OWN OPINION AN EACH OPINION SHOUKLD BE RESPECED AS SUCH I.E. AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONAL  O P I N I O N!!Now back to the review:  In this instance this is a novella, and this one is a short erotic vampire romance, I RECEIVED PRETTY MUCH WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A SHORT.  THIS NOVELLA IS A SEXY, SUFFICENTLY STEAMY, FUN VAMPIRE RUMP! However, it was atually longer than many of the ""novellas"" I've purchaed via amazon's kindle for your PC, brilliant idea by the way guys, i.e. making kindle ebooks available for other electronic devices.The author provides just enough character development given the expected limitations of any novella.  Given the aforementioned constraint, I recommend this as a fun read at a fairly appropriate price.  I plan to read the rest of this series despite the poor reviews the 1st book in the series received.  I truly appreciate the reviews but ultimately I make my own decision regarding whether I  purchase a particular book & so should everyone.  Besides, AMAZON'S CSR IS SO FAITHFUL TO IT READERS THAT UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WILL AT LEAST GIVE ONE A CREDIT TOWARD ANOTHER PURCHASE IF A CUSTOMER IS TRULY UNHAPPY WITH AN EBOOK PURCHASE.  THANKS AMAZON, THAT ONE OF THE REASON I ONLY PURCHASE KINDLE E BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOOD CSR!!!RECOMMED THAT YOU GIVE THIS ONE A TRY!  GLAD I DID!",JUST MY OPINION BUT I LIKED IT!
481,"To a certain extent, Zombie Literature has been done to death and beyond, even to the point where it has become fashionable to insert zombies into classic works like Pride and Prejudice.  This book marks a nice departure from standard zombie fare, while retaining enough of the genre to keep that nice post-apocalyptic feel that zombies are so good at providing.  While I like the single-minded focus of your average zombie, I found that the idea of a few smart zombies thrown into the mix added to the sense of peril.  It appears that most of the typos referenced in other reviews have been corrected and I thought that the book was well-written, suspenseful and even funny at times.  In addition, character development was good and I found myself looking forward to the second installment.  While by no means perfect, this is a really decent effort and fully merits 4 stars.","Actually, A Very Good Zombie Book"
482,"3.5 stars.I have to confess that I don't really know what to think. There are a lot of wonderful ideas in this story and I think they deserved more space to develop because some of the situations, especially those on the dream plane, faded to black and then came back too abruptly. Instead of the confusion of the main character, I was left only with a sense of disorientation.The setting was really fantastic. The story takes place on a train and the other protagonist is a mysterious man, part magician, part healer. Marco Satori is a very interesting character and he makes you hold your breath when he appears on the page. And he's very sexy.Edwin, from whose point of view we see the story, is melancholic and in need of salvation and Marco gives him awareness and also a spark of will to change the situation he is in.There is a paranormal twist, and it was a big thing, with a lot of information that made me crave for a longer story. I was left with the impression I was given only a teasing, abridged version of a great book.Beautifully written.",3.5 stars. It was like a teaser
483,The book wasn't bad but it also wasn't great. In the beginning I was just waiting for something to happen as these girls were just goofing around. Eventually some action took place and that caught my attention. The author was very descriptive of the scenery. There were sections when the character would have flashbacks and I found myself skipping through those to get back to the main story. The main story line was the best part. All the rest just seemed like fillers.,It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either

When the two of them enter the estate Mark leaves Jodi to break into the house, where she is unexpectedly confronted by the owner Sam. What Jodi doesn't realise is that Sam is there by arrangement with Mark to fulfill Jodi's secret fantasy. Just for fun Mark had persuaded her to write a list with her most secret sexual fantasies. This is her birthday surprise. Sam is an old college friend of Marks, and between the two of them they plan to give Jodi the best birthday a girls ever had.

Sam and Mark are old friends and when Jodi put down on her list that she would like a threesome amongst other things. Mark knew he would trust no one else near Jodi. What Mark had not counted on was how seeing Jodi with another guy would make him feel. This is a very good read, but be aware this contains graphic sex and explicit language.",BIRTHDAY GIRL
485,"Judgment was a really strange and different read for me.The system in Judgment was somewhat more difficult to understand. First off, the slaves were all women, and all came into the system non-consensually. The book was told by female Mischief, an American woman kidnapped from an airport by human traffickers.The society is set-up as a hierarchy in a ""school"" (if you will) of 200 female slaves, and the guards and ""headmasters"" who oversee them, and an ""overlord"" who runs the full operation (the quoted terms are my own, not necessarily as written in the book, btw).The women are subjected to tortuous stuff and poor living conditions to break their wills and force them to participate in this society, and eventually they behave so they can move up to the next level of slavery, which has different duties and different privileges, with the ultimate goal of being sold to a kind master or of becoming a personal slave and pampered companion to a ""Headmaster"" or the ""overlord."" Our protagonist, the unusually flame-haired Mischief, skips the rank nonsense and basically moves from 'newbie' to 'overlord's beloved pet' in a short period of time, but that's pretty typical of this kind of story, so I'm not knocking it.The real fascination with this story is that Mischief accompanies her Master to the US and gets separated from him, freaks out, and gets picked up by the police.She no longer is emotionally capable of feeding or dressing herself, and has no comprehension of the real world.The narrative flips between the now-Mischief in the hands of the police, and the then-Mischief when she was a newly captured slave.The level of her Stockholm Syndrome is extreme and shocking. That's pretty much all I'm going to say about that.Judgment is what I would call ""erotic fantasy"" - nothing you'd ever want to live, but interesting if you like reading about alter-society systemic sexual slavery, rough sex, torturous beatings, and a brainwashed protagonist with Stockholm Syndrom. It has all this, and good writing, to boot.There's a lot of time spent on Mischief's capture and the first few weeks in the system, before she settles into her role, then it's a lightening move into the present, and the transition was a little too quick for me. I would have like to have been privvy to more of the conflict that made her dear to her Master, and maybe even a little glimpse into a sex scene that she actually enjoys...",Systemic slavery
486,"I like the book and will read the others but the word usage and constant typos are distracting. At least someone should proof the manuscript before it gets this far. In the way distant past these people were called editors.Seriously, the errors come so often that it is actually difficult to follow the story sometimes. You find yourself looking for the next misuse of a word like ""there"" instead of the proper ""they're."" I mean this is pretty bonehead stuff and either show someone really just typing instead of writing or someone who is displaying a real lack of education. This happens pretty much every page.",Needs an editor - bigtime

That's how he meets Micah is his mate. Thomas makes love to him, claims him by biting him cementing the mating bond , and convinces Micah to come back to his ranch with him. He figures he'll explain the whole &#34;werewolf&#34; thing later because he thinks Micah is human. On the way back to Thomas pack they stop at a rest stop they are accosted by some bullies and all hell breaks out. When a neighboring pack is called in to do cleanup and discredit the bashers, the sheriff, Caleb, turns out to be a werewolf, an Alpha of his own pack and also recognizes Micah as his mate. Turns out Micah is a Tri Omega and doesn't know it. Micah was raised by an alcoholic father when his mother left when he was 12. After convincing Micah they he has two mates he agrees to go back to Caleb's house. When Micah gets frustrated and overwhelmed with emotion from the negative feelings pack members give him, he leaves the house against Caleb's orders, and Caleb makes it clear to him that if he ever disobeys him again, he'll take it as a personal challenge. A challenge to a werewolf is a fight to the death. Micah really doesn't understand they ways of the pack he is use to people hurting him and he is not taking it anymore. The sex scenes in this book was hot it wasn't until the rest of the pack come to meet the Alphas new mates that the learns that Micah is a werewolf when his Uncle Mike shows up and tries to take him away. Uncle Mike is really his father and that his mother is also a wolf who left because the man that raised him threatened them with exposure if they took him.

Mav's confused, but things are about to get a lot more confusing...If you've read Evangeline Anderson before, you probably have an idea of what Str8te Boys is like.  It's a quick, hot story of two guys who have always seemed straight, and what happens when they get together.  Mav and Duke are both jocks.  In a lot of ways they're typical college guys.  Their complicated relationship is revealed in bits and pieces, and I could easily see why Mav was so confused.  The sex scenes are hot, and there's a nice dose of angst.

496,"The Grimm brothers have nothing on Shiloh Walker, who tells a mean tale. Literally. This grim twist on Grimm is original, unique, and interesting, and Walker has penned another dark, rich novella to start an exciting new series. So much urban fantasy and paranormal romance is based around the idea that there's always a kernel of truth in all folk lore and fairy tales, and Walker not only embraces that ideology, she slams into it, tackles it to the ground, and hog ties it until it does her bidding!In Candy Houses, Greta and Rip are known to children everywhere as Gretel of Hansel and Gretel fame, and Rip as in Van Winkle, but neither one of the fairy tales and folk lore that surround them do more than glimmer at the truth. Greta, as she prefers to be called now, and Rip, didn't get anything resembling a happily ever after like the stories say. They got an immortal upgrade and were given wings, becoming a member of the Grimm, a group of guardian angels that are here to help humanity and save them from the myriad of dangers from other realms, demons, and other assorted nasties. Their wings are more metaphorical than actual, of course, but their skill is unmatched, and they're very hard to kill. They have to be. It's a dark, often lonely, deadly life that takes its toll on its warriors.Greta and Rip worked together about a hundred years ago and after a night of passion that rocked both their worlds, Greta fled, and hasn't been able to stop thinking of Rip ever since. And Rip knows that he may not survive another encounter with Greta, the woman he loved and lost after far too brief a time all those years ago. Could the fact that they've ended up in the same city at the same time, fighting what turns out to be the same fight be a good omen for them both? Perhaps Happily Ever After isn't out of the question after all?Candy Houses manages to develop both Greta's and Rip's characters with a surprising level of depth and complexity as well as provide a truly taut and tense plot that moves quickly even as it offers a lot of world building and mythos creation to start this series. I'm impressed again at Walker's ability to use what length allowed in her novellas to provide such a full reading experience, and I think the twist on the fairy tale idea is brilliant.The only caveat (IMO) was the final conflict at the end. With all the development and mythos explanation, Candy Houses is still limited to a novella length story, and there seems to have been a sacrifice made. There were motivations and explanations that didn't get explained, and the conflict with Big Bad ended up being a lot of hype with little hazard. It was a little of a letdown. Still, points for everything Walker manages to accomplish in this nifty little novella and I've already downloadedNo Prince Charming: Grimm's Circle, Book 2so I can continue with these dark and delicious fairy tales.",A Gem More Grim than Grimm

That's where I am with this book.I can't even give a very brief synopsis, other than an aunt and her consort are trying to marry off 3 sisters. They will choose their husbands from winners of a tournament. Much is made of 2 of the sisters competing in said tournament, but then no details of the tourney are given. None. Anyway, the sisters meet their suitors and smexy times ensue. And they all lived happily ever after.The sisters are basically all the same person.

Throw in a completely pointless menage...Now I like a good menage scene as much as the next girl, but this was not a good scene.Technically, the book is fine. No typos or distracting grammatical errors. The prose is flowery and lush.

I posit too that people in imminent danger of being murdered are not likely to take time out for some nookie while they are still in an extremely vulnerable locale.  Nor are they likely to take even more time to make a phone call from that locale - a call that could easily and safely be completed via cell phone as they sped away to a safehouse.Wish I could figure out which kind of tales these are before buying - its not always obvious.",this one's about the sex scenes

511,"I kind of take the reviews with a grain of salt, it's subjective to each person's viewpoint. I liked other books by this author like Collision Course and No Souvenirs. I thought ok it's a short story, it can't be that bad. I was wrong, it ended at 1109 locations, 66 percent. The ending was so abrupt, it wasn't just having a few questions. It was almost as if the story stopped in the middle, I expected to get the next chapter when I turned the page and all of a sudden I am staring at the author's bio and I can't figure out what happened. I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong. Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck. I have read many stories by this author, some I liked and some I didn't. However, I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now. I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well, but there was hardly any relationship development. Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry. If she had developed this story like the 2 books I already mentioned it would have been great. Mitchell chose the wrong story line for this short short story. I hope she revises and republished this story in a way longer format. I want to know what happens.

512,"My Dad, God bless him, was an avid fan of Lovecraft and I refused to read it when I was younger because of a  nightmare I had after one of his short stories.  Now I enjoy reading them.  Some are a little too repetitive in that he reuses certain material.  At least one had virtually no ending.  Some are too predictable.  All are well written and pleasant to read, just a little dated.  I would have to say overall that I enjoy the stories in the book and would recommend it if you are tired of some of the more modern trends in writing.  With Lovecraft you have to have an imagination.  He counts on it and plays with it in order to achieve his goal of giving you the creeps.  He takes you just so far and then lets your mind do the rest.  This requires a certain talent both from the writer and the reader.  A nice collection of stories to keep your mind occupied when you need it.",You really cannot go wrong here.
513,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first, but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok, it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So, I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you.",Nothing But Sex

515,"From the ""Cascadia Wolves"" series. Preceded byStandoff. Followed byTrinity.Plot:Shane has always denied his werewolf heritage. He lives as a human and prefers it that way. Megan has embraced her ""otherness""; she is a werewolf and proud of it. When fate mates them, they need to find a way to deal with their differences, or live apart.Comments:- A reasonable length book (2650 kindle locations).- Preceding books followed a ""Werewolf Mafia"" story arc. It was wound up in ""Standoff"". ""Fated"" would standalone, the other books are not necessary for the enjoyment/understanding of this book. However, as characters from other books appear and play an integral role in ""Fated"", reading the books in sequence would be of benefit.- ""Fated"" begins 2 years after ""Standoff"".- Shane was Layla's anchor inReluctant. He has not appeared in other books. Megan is the last Warden sister of the Cascadia Wolves Pack to be mated and is Lex's Enforcer.- The earlier books in the series (other than ""Reluctant"") mixed the action/suspense of the Pellini arc with romance/wooing/angst of newly mated relationships. As the war no longer exists, ""Fated"" is all about the relationship. It is chock-full of emotion, angst, hope, heartbreak. And lots of sex. No violence, no shooting, no war.- Sex is m/f with a very HOT m/f/m encounter. Sex is all loving, generous.Opinion:Yes, I like this series of books. I think Dane brings originality as well as humour and love to the Shifter/paranormal genre. The sex is always HOT and the characters are always well-defined and interesting. The women are STRONG, physically, emotionally. They stand up for themselves and don't let anyone walk over them. The men (heroes) are Alpha, they want their women to be protected. But they always love and celebrate their strengths, differences and power. Shane, in ""Fated"", struggles with the differences, because he struggles with his own. But Megan knows who she is and what she wants and fights for it. Another fabulous book in the Cascadia series.",A Shifter Romance with plenty of HOT sex and angst

521,"I read this one first, when it is actually #2 in the series.  I loved it!  Rachel Myers is a character that I really like.  She took her time to decide that she wasn't ready to commit to marriage to her beau in Arizona and decided to give up a good job that she'd held for 16 years and move back to where her roots are in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.  I also chose this book because I've been all through the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and it brought back nice memories of such beauty.Once Rachel gets about halfway settled in, her friend Isaac comes over to ask a favor of her.  A friend of his died by falling over a cliff to his death below, but police have ruled it either suicide or an accident, but Isaac knows in his heart it was neither.  He wants Rachel to do her own little investigation of this incident.  In between getting her house ready, her gardens done with the help of a landscaper, buying a new car, and meetings for her work, she manages to interview a lot of people who could be connected to Isaac's friend's death.  Some of them certainly have good motives, or at least it seems that way.One of the things I loved best about this book is the gardening and the discussions of the different kinds of flowers and plants that Rachel has.  I could just smell the lemon verbena (which is so hard to control!) and was amazed at the different kinds of hosta. Rachel is someone I could easily be friends with, and she would make a great conversationalist and just an all around fun friend.  There is humor in the book, tension, suspense and romance.  Her new suitor hopefully works out, as well as her new job.I intend to download as many as I can of these mysteries.  With cozy mysteries like this one, there is always something new to learn.  Cozy and mystery fans in general, go for it!",Blue Ridge Parkway Plunge is great!
522,"Maybe I didn't look too hard at the spelling or grammar problems.  I just enjoyed the story.  I had this book on my Kindle for almost a year and I figured it was about time I checked it out.  I am glad I did.  Nowhere as scary asThe Mistby Stephen King.  This really is a story about how a group of kids survive (for several years) being isloated from the rest of the world.  With no adults for awhile, and even then, with a young 14 old leader, called the Chief.  I am in my 50's and I liked the way Morris wrote his story.  If he ever decided to add to the story with a sequel, I would check it out.  Suitable for kids from 12 on up.",And a Child shall lead them!
523,"Oh, dear - another run-of-the-mill romance novel. I really must give up ordering them. This particular story was uninspiring, unentertaining and unimaginative. If, however, you like soft stories that don't tax the intellect in any shape or form, then this is it. As I believe that one should read the whole book before rendering an opinion, I plodded on, skipping some pages out of shear boredom. I know these stories are not written for the serious reader and just for entertainment, but this wasn't that either.",Not my cup of tea

525,"After reading 'Knowing Caleb' which I absolutely loved, I decided to explore more of this author's work. ReneCade didn't impress the way the first book did. I had a few problems. Ren and Cade come together fairly early in the book which was fine, but then the sex got repetitive and plot took a backseat for a few chapters.  Ren and Cade were interchangeably strong and insecure/needy, sometimes all within a matter of sentences.  Sometimes I couldn't figure exactly what they were angsting over as the conclusion they would draw from each other's actions didn't seem logical. The angst just seemed to be fabricated and drawn out for no good reason.  Cade's inability/unwilligness to forgive Ren's transgression, or even accept a portion of the blame, did not endear me to him.  Why he needed six months to forgive and fully commit to Ren after a) being so distraught when he thought Ren was hurt, b) having Ren wait on him hand and foot after HE was hurt, and c) after the scene with Ren's mother, was just beyond my comprehension and absolutely ridiculous.As far as characters went, I couldn't really get a handle on each of their personalities. With the exception of Cade being 'by the book' and a neat freak, they were pretty interchangeable emotionally, especially in the bedroom.Speaking of the bedroom (or anywhere else they had sex), I have never in my life seen characters talk as much during sex as this author's.  It bugged me slightly in ""Knowing Caleb"" but she really went to town here. I'm not talking post-coital pillow talk. I'm talking full fledged paragraphs of dialogue during the act. In one scene Cane actually orgasmed while Ren was still talking and I had to laugh because umm yeah, I don't need your damn life history!  Actually it's not just during sex, reading some of the dialogue will leave you breathless; there is just too much dialogue lumped together in one go. It just didn't feel natural.  And much of what they said was so flowery, I had to keep looking at the cover to remember that they were supposed to be men and not simpering schoolgirls.There were parts of the book that I did like and I actually cared for the characters, but surprisingly not the couple I was supposed to. I had a real soft spot for Ren/Tex. IMO, even though they were 'just' best friends and their sexual relationship was unbalanced in the beginning, they grew as individuals and were the only people who truly loved each other unconditionally. The fact that they had to go their separate ways to appease their respective spouses spoke volumes, both about their relationshp and the relationships they had with their spouses. At least Cane recognized that there was something very wrong with that.All in all this is an ok read.  I put it down a few times mostly because of Cade whom I truly rooted for in the beginning but who the author made unlikeable.  There are some strong points but this isn't a book I'll be reading again...or one I would recommend. Instead, I would suggest the following (also by Cameron Dane) -1) Knowing Caleb2) A Fostered Love3) Grey's Awakening (Cabin Fever)",Not What I Expected

I do believe Mr. Williams accurately displays how current society has no staying power in relationships. Instead of working through things, it's easier to toss it to the side and start anew with another. Which is exactly what Preston is doing and his conscience is working overtime trying to save him. He fails to acknowledge how his actions or lack thereof are affecting his current and unborn children. And to think, he is working his way through the ministry......oh no that is one church I would not be attending. This book much like the first, had poor editing and grammatical errors.

535,"Argus is in a dead-end job, with a crappy living situation and an uneventful life. He is largely absent from the world, choosing not to interact with his many roommates, and having little experience with quality human interaction. That is, this is Argus' life until now. A mysterious encounter with a stranger leaves Argus with a strange box filled with seemingly unrelated artifacts. He doesn't know what it all means, and, with an absent family and no real friends, he doesn't have anyone to ask. When one of his roommates reaches out to him in kindness one night and notices the odd collection, the roommates set out on an adventure to discover the meaning behind the mystery.Tom Lichtenberg has written a short novel that is both appealing and spellbinding as you discover clues right along with Argus. The desire to figure out the meaning behind the box of items keeps you reading until the end. That ending, however, felt somewhat abrupt and rushed, and was a bit of a disappointment after the path of discoveries. It is hinted that this experience has left Argus changed, and I would have liked a little more information about that change and what impact it might have. I wanted to know more about what happened to the other characters at the end as well. I wanted a little more, and I would be interested in further stories in this same vein.The writing style is unique, but well-suited to this type of unconventional story. The character of Argus is fairly well-developed. He is a very insular man who has very few authentic interactions with others, preferring to spend endless hours alone with his own thoughts. There is just enough information given to make you wonder more about Argus' family, as well as his experiences with others growing up. Some of this backstory may well be included in ""Snapdragon Alley,"" a prequel of sorts to this book, where Argus' older brother holds center stage. I also want to know much more about the character of Fulsom. How did he end up needing to be ""in charge"" of the situation presented at the end?MotherLode blog",Engaging and fun!
536,"I have to admit, it wasn't what I expected. I started reading this novel thinking it was an M/M Romance. Well, it wasn't. I'd categorize it as an M/M Mystery with mild romantic elements. I actually put it aside at one point because I was disappointed it lacked the romantic qualities I sought. That's not to say the writing wasn't fun. Just I expected something different. So here's my opinion of the book.Mystery: Here's the thing, I'm a romance novel type of girl. I don't remember the last time I read anything non-romance. Anyway, I picked it up again and finished it. As a Mystery, it was pretty great to my untrained eyes. I had no idea whodunit until around two thirds of the novel. Even then I wasn't completely certain, just a hunch. Nice.Humor: Quite a lot of humor; I laughed throughout the book. The internal dialogue was awesome--definitely my kind of entertainment with quite a few WTH moments.Romance: This is where it faltered, but I get the impression it wasn't truly meant to be a romance. In my humble opinion, it barely pushed the meter. I was halfway through the book before the two heroes decided to give any clear clues about their attraction. Sure, there were occasional hints, but nothing really substantial. It's like looking at an attractive guy walk down the street and thinking hmm..He's kind of cute. Really means nothing in the end.Eroticism: I have to be honest. It really didn't do it for me. I've never read M/M eroticism, but I've seen some racy scenes on TV which I loved. I don't know if it's because it's reading material and not visual stimulation which kept me from getting into the hot and bothered mode or not. I will say it was certainly interesting in a research type of way. I'm going to have to read a bit more M/M to see if it will actually get me excited.Realism: I had a bit of problems here. I don't hang out in the LGBT community. I've known a few lesbians, but no openly gay men. So I wonder if gay men really act like the guys in the novel or were they just stereotyped. I always figured gay folks lived lives like everyone else with everyday personalities. The MC and his buddy Sheppard seemed a bit dramatic at times. They kind of reminded me of characters who would play on Noah's Ark--a show I only managed to get through two episodes. Then again, Dan seemed like an everyday guy I'd meet on the street with human motives. I liked him, and I could relate to him. So I wonder; were the guys in this novel authentic? If not, I'd love to read a book where the gay people truly act the way people in the gay community/world would act. Leave me a note if you have any suggestions.The only true complaint I had with the novel was a couple of moments when I had no idea who was talking--tags just not properly placed. I made educated guesses about the speakers, and I suppose it didn't make too much difference as far as the story unfolded. Still, it would have been nice to know who said what.Thanks for the read LB Gregg!",Not What I Expected but Still Decent

538,"I readThe Naughty Little Tower Room: Erotic Romance Fantasyand was looking for another great, sexy romance novel when I stumbled across this book. This was definitely what I was looking for. ""Bonded by Need tells the sexy, erotic story of a trio of characters who simply can't keep their hands off each other. At least the men can't seem to keep their hands off Jayda. Jayda is a polymorphic shifter, which means she can transform from a human to a wolf or a cougar. She's recently moved to a new town and is now meant to marry the head of the wolf council.Jayda and the wolf council leader Cole are bonded together and destined to be married. The wolf part of Jayda is happy for the connection and Jayda hopes that all of her can be satisfied by the relationship with Cole. But her cougar side is crying out for someone else. That someone else just happens to be the head of the cougar council, Zane. Both men are obsessed with Jayda and can't seem to stay away but can either one actually satisfy her completely?Cole wants to be life mates with Jayda and believes that he is the only one for her. But Zane can't resist the seduction Jayda employs to try and get him for herself. Jayda wants both of the men but can she really have them both? Everything is starting to change as more and more people are killed and Jayda will need to make a choice before someone else ruins everything for good. But can she really choose between the two different sides of herself? And can she choose between the two men who both promise to satisfy her so well?This book is a great story about how one woman can be torn in more than one direction. I think Jayda is a character that nearly any woman could relate to since she seems like she's in a struggle between herself to choose which mate will be the best for her. This is a lot like just about any woman who is trying to make a choice that could prove to be incredibly important to her as time goes on. The two male characters are each hot and amazing in their own right and you'll be rooting for each of them by turns as they show their true colors and their true feelings for Jayda.This book is a great story about romance and love as well as involving some supernatural elements in the form of the shape shifters and the things they have to face in order to make their way through life. If they don't make some decisions quickly, decisions will be made for them and the results may not be good at all.",Amazing Combination of Love and Supernatural

As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read. The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed. The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow. Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other.

Brody loves Sidney and sharing her with anyone would never have even come up if he hadn't noticed that some of her preferred reads involve m&eacute;nage relationships.Drew Buchanan isn't the settling down kind of guy and he never stays with any one woman for very long.  He leads more of a nomadic lifestyle and often sails off on his yacht aptly named `Sunset.'  He's a brilliant desert chef and creates his delectable treats for Brody's restaurant, The Blue Fish Grill, whenever he's in Graceville but he's finding it harder and harder to stay in town especially since he's in love with Sidney.Sidney McCall has always lived a nomadic lifestyle.  Her mother never stayed in one place very long and she simply continued the lifestyle she already knew - until she met Brody.  They quickly moved from the initial meeting to living together and even a year after the fact, Sidney still feels like it's all a dream.In celebration of their first anniversary together Sidney plans to surprise Brody with a delicious meal along with a sexy outfit when he returns home from the restaurant - and succeeds.  Brady had intended to tell Sidney that he'd invited Drew over and about his surprise but one look at her in her sexy dress and all his brain cells headed south.  Dinner's put on hold while they satisfy other hungers - until they hear the knock at the door and then Brody remembers that he still has to tell her about his `gift.'  Sidney can't deny an attraction to Drew and even though she isn't entirely comfortable with the idea of sex with two men at the same time it is a fantasy of hers and if it's alright with the men then who is she to argue.  Things turn decidedly odd afterwards and Sidney's not sure what to think about Drew's cold disinterested attitude and to make things even more complicated Brody notices her preoccupation and assumes that it's more than just friendly concern.Sami Lee delves into what could happen when the thing you fantasize about turns out to be the exact opposite of what you truly desire.  Sidney and Brody are deeply in love with each other but neither of them are truly certain of the others feelings.  I found the dynamics between these three characters to be oddly fascinating but at the same time understand why Drew's held himself apart from Brady and Sidney.  I'd love to know what happened with Drew after this story ends.

I was glad that it ended in a way that let me feel that she and Venturi would just be friends and her relationship with Valentine would be solid. Then I made the mistake of reading the preview for Spellbound at the end. What!? No way Valentine is okay with that nonsense, just because he accepted that she felt some love for Venturi, and that was even stretching it for me, doesn't mean he'd be okay with that! I guess I loved the first book and then it all slowly went downhill for me because of this. I wish it could have been a stronger relationship between Valentine and Prophecy, because no matter how often prophecy says it's not even a fraction to what I feel for you to Valentine it's still inappropriate to my mind.

Have you ever joked about how in books and movies you never see people eating or going to the bathroom? This book is a testament to why that is. It is not interesting to read about. The story has a lot of potential--a suspicious disappearance, a mysterious cat, shady politicians, a police cover-up--and despite all this the protagonist spends most of the time getting her train ticket punched. The author makes a big deal about the strange cat who follows her around, but once they get underway it literally does nothing but poop in the hotel room.

I would do it but I think my eyes would melt if I read one more boring word of this book). It's really painfully obvious from the beginning what happened to the husband, and who is the bad guy, and the ""truth"" about magic.

The parts about the magicians are waaaay more interesting than Miranda reading a newspaper. Which she does. A lot. I only finished it to find out what happens, and that was disappointing too.

This wasn't helped by the fact that the heroine's decisions become increasingly difficult to comprehend and so much of the explanation of why she never does the obvious and logical thing each time she has a choice comes so late in the book that it's likely almost impossible for the reader to identify with her reasoning. She seems by far a weaker rather than a stronger character because of this. The final resolution seems equally incomprehensible; a good literary surprise comes as the inevitable twist that you should have seen coming, but this was simply out of left field.Some of the heroine's self-realizations are intriguing and well-written, but rather in the same way that the author repeats the same scenario over and over, she repeats these moments of self-awareness again and again.Two stars for the descriptions and atmosphere.",Good atmosphere setting but the plot loses focus and becomes repetitive

560,"I thought a book about a closted small town southern cop would have more smouldering heat to it,  but this book because blatantly sexual pretty quickly.  I didn't actually have a clear picture of Rich,  who was 35,  repressed, in love with Dan.  And Dan,  the eternal ladies man who never finds any woman perfect enough for him,  well that pressed a few of my buttons too!  Both these men felt younger than their age to me. And the evil ex girlfriend was such a caricature,  she was just a plot device,  not  human at all.  In fact the most adult person was Jeremy,  Rich's not so ex,  who was mature and quite lovely and I hope good things happen to him!So I will read Shayla Kersten again,  but I would like it if her heros acted truer to their age,  these boys felt like they were in their mid to late 20's,  frankly I think figuring out you are gay at 34 shows a real lack of insight!",not as intense as I wanted it to be

566,"Why ruin a good book with sex scenes?This was a hard book to read, but that was to be expected- it's very depressing subject matter.  It was well handled, though, fairly well written for the most part. I would give it a 3 or 4 star rating, if it wasn't for the 2 sex bits. They didn't fit the rest of the story, and pulled me out of it completely. Unnecessary, ill-suited to the story.

571,The Cedar Cove Series is written so anyone any age can enjoy the story.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest I could relate to many of the area references.  The story held my interest because there are so many stories going on at the same time.  Unfortunately the TV rendition changed a few of the events and personalities of the characters and that to me detracted from the book rendition.  I read all 6 books and enjoyed picking up the story each and every time I left off and resumed the books.  Good writing and story telling.,Fabulous Story
572,"I like the characters, I like the setting, I like the way the story starts to develop but I don't like the wham-bam finish. The story is just building nicely when, all of a sudden, the villian is confronted and it's all over. Where is the mystery, the red herrings, the twists and turns of plot?This is not a novel, it's a novella. At 1008 locations (roughly 100 pages I think) it's a very short read. Unfortunately the author has not made this clear in the product description and is selling it as if it were a full length novel. I thought the first book (Blind Malice) in the series borderline on length (1800 locations) and chose to try this, the second, but have been disappointed by its brevity. The next few in the series also appear to be around the same length as this one judging by the file sizes and I won't be buying any more unless the author clearly identifies her product as a novella, and prices it accordingly. The current price may be OK for US readers but add in another $2 for international Whispernet and it's no longer value for money.Edit: The extra $2 charge finally came off the Australian region price. I have resumed reading this series as I really enjoy the lovely Blue Ridge mountain setting.",Good story but far too short
573,"This short story is very confusing.I have no issue with unreliable narrators, but it is difficult to tell what is happening in this story because the writing is too poor for readers to be able to draw any conclusions.  Virtually everybody in the story has difficulty relating to others.  Conversations begin and then trail off without any important information being related.  The author doesn't prevent any ""normal"" interactions for us to be able to judge if the characters are the ones who have difficult understanding normal human interactions or if the problem actually is with him.  I had assumed that a main character was mentally unbalanced and waiting for that to develop throughout the story.  However, when the story ended, apparently he had become ""normal,"" making a very unfulfilling conclusion.  Why set up a ""weird"" situation for a short story with all this foreshadowing and then leave it unexplored and unexplained?  The only way the author can advance the story is to tell us -- in simple sentences -- what type of people the characters are (things like:  He was a nice person.  He liked people.  He didn't know why, that was just the way he was).  We're never shown anything through the action of the story.  People are just put in situations, have weird, trailing-off conversations, and then we're subjected to basic statements about the type of people that they are.The environment isn't very realistic either.  Because of some odd wording, I thought at first that maybe the story was set in another country -- but then a character mentions being from ""Michigan,"" which is the only sense of place we got in the story.  We know we're not in Michigan and we're in a city.  Don't hope for anything more specific.  It's a place where a independent office supply story is still in business (and can afford to pay ten dollars an hour for part time help) -- but is it in modern times?  Don't hope for anything specific, because it won't be happening.The characters seem not to know things that we would know.  For example, a character was in ""the war"" and has returned home and worked another type of job.  Later, ""old bruises"" on his face are thought by other characters to be from ""the war.""  However, human healing doesn't work that way and all humans should be aware of that.  Bruises, even ""old"" ones, have to be relatively recent and not from old trauma.The experience of reading this story is kind of like if another species was writing about humans and their interactions.  We know we don't act that way, but to a elephant, these interactions might make sense.The proofreading is better than some earlier reviews stated (I'm going to guess issues were corrected), but still not a professional job.",What is this?

581,"Relentless is the 5th of a series of six books by Jack Campbell that collectively tell the story of Captain John Geary and his command of the space fleet which belongs to an Alliance of worlds occupied by humans.  The  books in series order are: 1) The Lost Fleet: Dauntless, 2) The Lost Fleet: Fearless, 3) The Lost Fleet: Courageous, 4) The Lost Fleet: Valiant, 5) The Lost Fleet: Restless, and 6) The Lost Fleet: Victorious.The Alliance has been in a state of war for 100 years with another group of human worlds called the Syndicated Worlds, or Syndics for short.  John Geary was thought to have been killed in the early opening attacks of that war.  In reality, he escaped certain doom in a survival pod launched from his Heavy Cruiser.  He was placed in a state of hibernation, with the expectation that he would be picked up in a few weeks, but something went wrong.  The emergency beacon on his pod failed, and he drifted until he was accidentally found 100 years later by another Alliance Battle Cruiser.He was revived and found himself thrust into command of the entire Alliance Fleet (which was lost deep behind enemy lines) and expected to miraculously get the Fleet home safely and to put and end to the war once and for all, and he was to do this against the overwhelming forces of the Syndicate Worlds.Compounding his problems is the fact that he must deal with a group of rebellious officers among his own crew, a love relationship that can not be acknowledged, politicians at home who want to arrest him when he gets there for a crime he has not committed and for which there is no evidence to suggest that he ever thought of committing it.  And if that were not enough, he also has to deal with an unknown enemy with unknown technological capabilities that is known to exist just beyond the border that marks the extreme edge of Syndic space.If you like SciFi that's filled with space battles based on reasonably thought out tactical plans and strategies, this series may be for you.  It is much closer to reality than the Lensman series, though I will not say that is a better or worse story line.  That is for the reader to decide.",Relentless
582,"This is a collection of some of Doc Smith's storied.  It is not the Lensmen Series but some of his other (earlier) works (The Galaxy Primes, Masters of Space, The Skylark of Space, Skylark Three, Spacehounds of IPC, Subspace Survivors, Triplanetary, and The Vortex Blaster).

586,"I'm not fairy tales redux, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in one sitting. This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot,the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior, but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice, but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.  So, I totally bought it and her not wanting to have sex with him but liking it because when she firsts meets him she's instantly attracted to him.This was another great read from Eve Vaughn.",Deliciously Wicked Spin on a Common Fairy Tale

594,"I could easily be talked into giving this four stars for its high adventure, intriguing mystery and appealing characters. You've got to love a book that grabs you right from the beginning:""Are we rising again?"" ""No on the contrary."" ""Are we descending?"" ""Worse than that, captain! We are falling!"" ""For heavens sake heave out the ballast!"" ""There! The last sack is empty!"" ""Does the balloon rise?"" ""No!"" ""I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!"" ""Overboard with every weight!...everything!""I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a ""my boy"" or ""my man""  or ""my friend"" (e.g., ""'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...""). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist. This book is a classic for a reason.",Rollicking adventure

606,"One of the things I love so much about paranormal/fantasy novels is their amazing attention to detail.  Worlds beyond comprehension are created and characters, with otherwise impossible abilities, are summoned up from the imaginarium of the authors mind.Now, all that being said I was pretty excited by the idea of a ""paranormal-magic tracking"" private investigator, unfortunately having a fantastic idea doesn't always equal great execution.For those of you who have ever watched a film noir  or noir shorts you will easily understand the format for ""Tracking Magic (Max Killian Investigations)"" Here was a novel that was written as a series of short stories which are (when you break it down) actually case files for the PI Max Killian, (a somewhat blase' middle-aged investigator who -to be honest- makes a brick wall sound exciting.)After Schnieder's 1st story ""Haunting Clues"",  (which I thought ended abruptly and had no substance) I was certain things would get better... there was just so much potential there, but instead of getting better, (expanding the personal attributes of Max or even bringing in references of older cases) the stories just...stayed the same. They were (in places) mildly entertaining, but the obvious repetition in the beginning of each story ( yes - I get it, you don't tell people you can smell magic because then you will be taxed by the government) had me tuning out.Would I count ""Schnieder"" out of the writers talent pool? No... she just needs to focus more on where she wants her ""Hero"" to go.Do I think ""Tracking Magic"" is worth the time? Well since it only took me 2 and a half hours to read, sure... I'm just not all that sure I'd want to pay $2.00 for that 2 hours.Read if you have NOTHING else.Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: The IRS eventually finds everyone.. there is no point in hiding... they are like a bad case of Ebola with no vaccine.",Reviewed by Kindleobsessed
607,"I can't express how much I hated the heroine Eryhaen. She was petty, selfish, childish, cruel, and rapped up in her own self-worth. Because she is the first girl born into the dark elves she thinks she is above everybody else and doesn't have to follow the rules. Her father, the king, even forbids her to do somethings and the moment she is out of his presence she does them anyway thinking she knows best. In short she is a bee itch.After the second book the story became more serious and complex and with it my interest and enjoyment decreased. I don't know if this is the reason or because I didn't care much for the characters but the sex scenes weren't very interesting to me. I remember a few years ago when I got the first two books and they were great.

That seems unlikely given that Kim Kardashian has made an entire career out of having a huge butt and a very well distributed sex tape (Thanks Mom!). So....I didn't get the big deal.

Man and machine really can succeed without the machine becoming evil and trying to take over the world; embracing technology speeds up the process that our slow incremental evolution is already working on.Some of the speeds of travel and communication seem to be a little reaching but hey, this is science fiction and some science fiction will become science fact during our lifetimes.

616,"I'll admit that most of my problems with the book are related to my personal preference.  It is a very well-written, thought-out, and developed book, and I'm sure a select audience will enjoy what it contains, it just wasn't for me.  I  thought the world building was great, and the cast of characters diverse.  There were space battles, innovative technology, and even a dash of romance.Now, I enjoy having things explained to me, especially when it contributes to the mental image I can bring forth when looking at a fictional universe. However, in this book entire chapters were devoted to the descriptions of the technology and the related physics involved, as well as the extensive workings of the political sphere and social changes as described by the passive voice. This took me out of the story, made it a struggle not to skip ahead,  and screwed with the pacing of the book.  It also sacrificed character and plot development which could have helped the flow, and (IMO) more action which would have made it a more fast-paced, enjoyable read.I also disliked the protagonist and found him an annoying perspective to follow.  He, and various minor characters, were not simply naive, but held a sense of idealistic pacifism about them that made me shake my head and think, 'surely you can't be this stupid'...  He was also whiny, sheltered, easily distracted, and incredibly trusting; leading to him refusing to believe anything was wrong until everything had gone to hell.Finally, the book was just plain depressing to read.  The same political, religious, and social problems we have today are prevalent some fifty odd years in the future. The essence of humanity, our ability to rise up and conquer anyone and anything that threatens our existence and freedom (something most military scifi novels embrace) simply wasn't there.  Humanity almost self-destructs, they're treated with suspicion, experiences defeats and failure at the hands of others, is at multiple times at the complete mercy of others...

Finding no one to claim him, Elain agrees to take him home with the hopes of finding his owner.  She has no idea that the huge furry dog is not actually a dog but a wolf. Nor does she even think to consider that the wolf is not a canine but a man.  When the dog's owners show up to claim their lost pet, Elain is sad to see him go but returns him anyway.  The next day, she receives a phone call from one of the owners inviting her to lunch.  When she meets the man, she is surprised to see he is a twin and that both men are luscious. Allowing them liberties she never even could have considered, Elain's life changes the minute they touch her.Ain, Brodey, and Cail are identical alpha triplets.  As such, fate tells of only one woman for the three men to love - their soul mate.  When Brodey smells an enticing scent at the Highland Games, he can't help but follow it.  He knows that Ain, the Prime of the three will be angry, but he is willing to take that chance because if his nose is correct, then he has just found the woman nature has intended to complete his family.I found myself laughing out loud at the antics of Brodey and Cail.  Ain was the oldest and the most intense.  Brodey was the most playful of the three, and Cail seemed the happiest.  All three were sin personified and simply dreamy.  Ain's emotions concerning Elain worried me at first - he was so stubborn in wanting Elain to love them on her own terms and by her own choice.  Ain's willingness to sacrifice a lifetime of being unmated rather than force Elain to mate with he and brothers grabbed my heart and didn't let go.TROUBLE COMES IN THREES is sexy, scorching hot, and fun to read.  Tymber Dalton's ability to weave a story keeps me coming back for more and reading everything she releases.  Lovers of paranormal m&eacute;nage romances with a hint of comedy should run and grab this enticing book.  It was great!Natalie S.",Reviewed by Romance Junkies!

624,"I had high hopes for this novel.  Given the subject matter and the fact that I'm a fan of historical fiction (Follett, Kalogridis) I tore into Children of Salem shortly after downloading it.I was disappointed.I won't to into too much detail about the plot.  Jeremy Wakely is sent from Boston to look into the questionable practices of a puritan minister in Salem, Mass. Jeremy has a history in Salem and is reluctant to go back but he does so out of honor...and because of a girl.  Jeremy is thrust neck deep into the mystery and lunacy that was the Salem Witch Trials of the late 17th century.The Salem Witch Trials was one of the darkest and most interesting periods in American history.  With that as a backdrop, I was very much looking forward to tearing my way through this book.It's not that Walker's a bad writer.  The historical aspects are well covered and he does give the reader a good sense of how it was for people living in that area of the country at that time in history.No, the main problem with this book is the pacing.  It's S-L-O-W.  It says it's a little over 400 pages but it certainly feels longer than that.  The book is filled with frequent drawn out conversations where the participants seem to be reiterating the same things over and over again.  Frankly, it spoiled my enjoyment of the book.I'm not an instant gratification type of reader.  I don't mind a nice build up to a big reveal or a good ending but sometimes I felt it was a chore to get through the conversations to see what the next development in the story was.The love angle between Jeremy and Serena didn't seem to 'pop', that's the best way I can think to describe it.  I think it's partially because many of the characters just seemed to read the same way.  With a few standouts, most of the characters seemed to speak the same exact way and had the same type of personalities.I don't mean to bash it.  I'm sure this novel couldn't have been easy to write, especially considering the historical aspect of it.  It just left me feeling a little let down.I didn't think it was bad, I didn't think it was great either.  I give it a solid 'okay'.",slow

632,"OK this is a Trilogy so I would highly recommend buying all three because once you start reading this book you will want to read them all.  The author was new to me but for a dollar I figured I'd take a chance.  I brought all three books and was glad I did because once I finished the first one I had to know what was going to happen next.  Is this a great work of fiction maybe not but it is worth your time.  I would say the biggest issue I had with the book was the editing.  It can be a little distracting when you find obvious typos but other than that the story moved along, the characters were well developed and I'll just have to wait to see how things turn out in the last book.

634,"After reading the sample for this I was disappointed by the rest of it. It seemed like there would be more mature writing and a deeper plot. However, the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying. Laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters. The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature. Now while this can be a part of a character, no one is perfect after all, there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that Laine could act like more than a teenager. At least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession, but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this story, even for the cheap price. It's short and doesn't really make the reader feel any emotion.",Don't buy

Others have commented on her narrow minded view of men, (which is true) but I found the fact that she was mean to her elderly neighbor to be an even bigger turn off.I've already wasted a couple hours reading this book, but it's not too late to save yourself.

646,"I can see why many here enjoyed this book to the tune of four or five stars but for me, it failed on many different levels. If you are like me, it will most likely fail for you too. I'll try to convey my issues without any spoilers, but that restriction makes my task difficult.The setup is that the US has been supplying Turkey with weapons which Turkey has been using to exterminate Kurds. At one point, the book states that thousands of Kurd towns were destroyed with no telling how many Kurds were killed. Unable to stop the Kurds using these tactics, the Turks called for US support. In response, the US invaded and occupied Turkey to the purpose of suppressing the Kurdish objection to being exterminated. As a retaliation for the US supplying arms to the Turks and now for the US soldiers actively assisting in the genocide, some Kurds infiltrate the US to start a campaign of terror to get the US out of the Turkish / Kurdish fight. This is the setup and bluntly, at that point, I was ready to drop this book as perhaps too depressing to continue just due to this scenario. I mean, who is the bad guy at this point?Well, the author makes sure that the Kurds in the US are painted as so evil that you must side against them, but I keep thinking of those thousands of Kurdish villages so casually dismissed in this book on the way to making the Kurds and the leader of the terror campaign evil incarnate. Don't get me wrong. I have no tolerance for terror, but also have none for genocide either. The book offers a choice of nauseating alternatives for the good guys.As to the unfolding of the story (FBI and allies to stop the terror campaign) a good deal of the 'action' is laughable. Here are a few examples I can cite without spoilers. If I were willing to do spoilers, this review would be thousands of words long and a lot funnier.The Kurds are depicted as heartless superbly trained killers yet when they use a captive to lure others into a trap, they untie the captive sufficiently to allow him to signal his rescuers that this is a trap. In another scene, the gimlet eyed Kurdish assassin is charged with stalking and killing a victim. Rather than just shooting the victim, the assassin, in the best James Bond tradition, grabs the proposed victim up, puts her in a car and aimlessly drives around long enough for her to engineer an escape. In another gripping scene, this trained and expert assassin shoots a victim (with a 9 mm pistol) at close range, in the back of the head but she not only lives through it, but doesn't even seem to have much of a headache.In another asinine setup, the FBI needs to question a bunch of good old boys in a country bar to find the location of another country boy who may know the location of the terrorists. A reasonable tactic would be entering the bar and just saying ""We're the FBI looking for the terrorists. Can you tell us the address of So and So?"" That would have worked, but instead, the FBI female dresses up in costume to use sex to winnow the address from one of the bar's patrons. When that doesn't work, the FBI (and FBI ally) end up shooting, beating and terrorizing the patrons until they get the info they seek. Yikes! These guys are rednecks from Arizona. If you asked, they'd take up arms and attack the terrorists themselves. No need to shoot and beat them.One more example. After the terrorism starts in the US, the law enforcement community starts a manhunt, of course, to find the terrorists. They can't find them but when the Maryland mafia decides it wishes to find them, it does so in about 15 minutes with no explanation except an oblique comment about tracking them through their sewage. After the mafia finds the bad guys locale, it fails to inform the FBI for most of the book which gives the bad guys some more time to commit atrocities.I haven't even gotten to the superhuman powers some FBI agents have or the utter stupidity supposedly committed by senior White House staff - all utterly unbelievable.If you just want to rah rah the US and  can dismiss the portrayed genocide of Kurds and can suspend disbelief when superhuman FBI agents get stymied by bozo Kurd terrorists, this one is for you. If you are sickened by the killing, then perhaps not.",A Major Dissent

648,"""I'm a left-leaning organic farming peacenik, and you're a dedicated member of the military-industrial complex.""Soleil Freeman and West Morgan had a brief affair five months ago. Although they heated up the sheets, their short lived liaison was more notable for the fighting. Now, months later, Soleil is noticeably pregnant and still in semi denial. A child had never been in her game plan. Added to that, she is struggling with exactly how to (whether to) tell West. He is a Special Forces officer in the Air Force and has been back at his base in Colorado since their last and, as it turns out, most consequential encounter.But surprise! West has come back to town to take care of his father who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and he runs into a Soleil who has some explaining to do.After I read this book I was both very impressed and profoundly disappointed. I think my disappointment comes from the fact that this was a nice read, but there was a great read struggling to get out. There was so much here that the reader could sink their teeth into and, unfortunately, none of it got the treatment it deserved.This book touched on the following: political identity & idealism, divorce, single parenthood v. marriage, how children view their parents and vice/versa, the ways in which children internalize parental expectations, and how love works with all of these.I think the cover of the book is so incredibly misleading. It is not some bubbly tale of a secret baby. Soleil's pregnancy and her reconnection with West is the main story, but the subplots and secondary characters are very vital and interesting in the story and are much deeper than the cover implies. And therein lies my biggest problem. I was incredibly engrossed in West's struggle with dealing with the twin blows of impending fatherhood and the fact that his larger than life father was going through terrifying bouts of dementia. I was equally drawn in by Julia's, West's mother's, re-entry into the dating world (she and West's father have been divorced for many years) and the wonderful new guy she meets. And I was incredibly intrigued by the very prickly, yet fascinating relationship Soilel has with her famous, idiosyncratic mother. BTW, I loved Soleil's background -- her hippie, down with the establishment middle class white-bread mother becomes a radical and hooks up with a Black Panther who himself later becomes establishment thereby dooming that relationship. Lol. Soleil's mother is a One woman character play waiting to happen.SO when the book ends with only West and Soleil's relationship sewn up, I felt like I was cut adrift. Even the resolution of West and Soleil's relationship wasn't completely satisfactory. It seemed so incredibly rushed. The two of them were coming from fundamentally different places. I never felt the two of them came together adequately for each other. Sure they pledge their love, but it is a Harlequin, you expect that. I didn't completely feel it. Don't get me wrong, the author creates a great connect between the two but she really needed more pages to explore it more.And that is the crux of the issue for me. I think this book needed a good 100 to 200 more pages to really satisfy me. The writing here was very good and the characters were excellent. I simply needed more time with them.",very impressed and vey disappointed
649,"I feel as if I am reviewing two separate and distinct books that just happened to have many of the same characters.  The first book seemed to be about a guy with no particular job or goal in life except when he needed to replenish his bank account enough to stock the fridge with more steaks and beers.  At one point he finds a teenage girl on the beach who is exceedingly drunk.  So drunk that he takes her to his home and puts her to bed twice changing her clothes and she being naked.  Then we zoom back to the present day where  he knocks up his girlfriend and the rest of the first book is all about arguing both sides of the abortion/pro-life/pro-choice issue. As we read about the issue(s) involved this guy gets shot at and delivered a package of blood and tissue representative of an aborted fetus.  At no time does he ever call the police.  He calls his drinking buddy.  The drunk teenage girl disappears and her mother comes to this guy requesting that he find her.  He has pissed off the pregnant girlfriend who tosses him out on his ear, and the missing teen is killed in a traffic accident,  so he decides to go undercover as a humble hayseed who travels to where the girl was killed to get the real story. Things that make you go hmmmmmmm.Now we are at book two where humble hayseed gets himself hired as a handyman at a convent where something shady is going on.  The convent just happens to take care of pregnant teens and a mysterious black limo appears at night and pregnant teens give birth but their babies seem to disappear.  I'm sure you can figure out the rest.The book(s) isn't awful, but the author appears to have written two different books -- one that needed a beginning and one that needed an ending so he stuck them together and voila.And although I have no problem with stretching the believability scale when reading fiction, I gotta tell ya I don't believe a man is going to pick a drunk out of her gourd teenage girl and have her naked twice in his bed but nothing happens.  No man is that low on testosterone or that saintly.  What guy would be stupid enough to set himself up for a rape accusation.  Then he gets shot at and does nothing but spackle the holes in the wall?If you have time to kill and $2.99 you can't decide how else to spend go for it.

659,"A fast-paced British thriller? I had to read this.Unfortunately there are some issues which bring the book down badly and that's why I've only given it two stars. SPOILERS ALERT.Firstly, the plot is really nonsensical. We've two senior police officers with a) nothing else to do and b) an easygoing attitude towards letting interested members of the public see what's going on behind the scenes. Apart from the sheer unlikeliness of it, there's also the question of verbal evidence contamination, breaches of privacy and so on.Secondly, the point of view chops and changes so much that, if this were a film, it'd be quite unwatchable. There were times when I knew things that I didn't know because I was still inside the head of the character whose eyes I'd been seeing through a few sentences prior.Thirdly, the characters are very thin and cardboard cut-out-like. The women are gorgeous, the men are good or bad and the whole thing more than a bit contrived.I'm really pleased to say that there were some good points. The story itself has a fascinating premise (I liked that a lot), there was some light relief at times (liked that, too) and the setting stayed reasonably steady (some books can turn into travelogues) until the ending when it really lost the plot (pun intended) bigtime.British crime thrillers like this benefit from being gritty and realistic - this (very sadly) wasn't.","Nice idea, shame about the execution"
660,"The Classmate Murders is a fun and clever mystery. The story is written mostly in narration style, which works perfectly with this main character. You can almost hear the character's voice as he tells the story and adds his own brand of humor.Jim Richards is a regular guy, who is mature, divorced, and living with his parents to help take care of his dad. When he finds his long-ago high school classmates are being murdered, he and his friends step in to try to find the killer and protect Penny, his new-found love. I have read many books with female civilians getting caught up in a murder mystery, but this time it is a man who noses his way into the action. The cops don't like it - until he comes up with some interesting clues. I enjoyed the variety and personality differences in the characters. It is also fun to read about people closer to my age.It is a reminder to younger people that love can bloom at any age, but I thought the romantic antics started to get in the way of the mystery. Eventually it got back on track and came through with a satisfying wrap up to the case.  I especially enjoyed the last part of the book that sets the stage for the following books.This is an enjoyable and distinctive kind of mystery.",The Classmate Murders
661,"Elysia and Darien live in a world where modern society has completely collapsed, and they share a secret.  Each is called by an animal spirit to help guide mankind into a new way of living.  Will they join in this new society, or try to survive on their own?This novella is a prequel to a trilogy of the same subject matter, so it is intended to be merely an introduction to the characters and situation, and that is exactly how I saw it.  It was but a taste of what was to come, to allow readers to determine if this series would be for them.  While we do not learn enough about Elysia and Darien to make a deep connection to them, we do make some connection, enough to push us on to read the trilogy.I personally am not a huge fan of post apocalyptic literature, so for me, that was where more of the problem with the book lies.  Similarly, the whole animal spirit aspect does not particularly interest me.  I think people who are very interested in Native American religion and philosophy will be quite interested in this book, but for me, a person begin guided by a squirrel is more than a little corny.That being said, I do think the novella was well written, and worth reading.  For those who read the novella and like it, I think the trilogy will be a good match.","Not bad, just not for me."
662,"Sydney Somer's Primal Hunger is one of those stories that disappoint me, not for what it is, but for what it could be and yet isn't. Full of interesting mythos, a spunky heroine with a backbone, and an Alpha male to drool for, the building blocks exist to make this title a really fantastic paranormal romance. Unfortunately, the combination of the length of the story (far closer to novella than mass market paperback) and the focus on the sexual relationship between the two main characters, Kennedy and Tristan, kept this book from truly blossoming into a fully satisfying read for me. And that's a shame, because there really was a lot to like about Somer's writing style and creativity here.Ultimately, there just wasn't enough story to raise my appreciation for the book higher than three stars. I'm a huge fan of erotic fiction. I actually prefer my books with healthy, adult, explicit sex scenes that help define and enhance the romantic pairing between couples in paranormal romances, and I'm very open minded about sex in general. Flowery euphemisms and delicate wording are a turnoff - in life and in books. That being said, however, my preference is that the story comes first and the sex scenes be a part of that story, not the whole of the story. In Primal Hunger, the sex (while steamy, hot, and very erotic) was the center of the story and the plot and mythos about the gargoyles, wraiths, Avalon, King Arthur, Fae, as well as the development of the emotional side of Kennedy and Tristan's relationship, were more like random leaves being tossed around in the cyclone of the sexual relationship. That was such a shame, because I love gargoyles and wish there were more paranormal romances that featured them, and Arthurian novels have always been an interest of mine. By the end, I basically enjoyed Primal Hunger for what it is, but felt disappointed by all the missed opportunities to raise the bar. Still, I've got the  second in the Pendragon Gargoyles series, Primal Attraction, so I'll be giving the series at least one more go.","Enjoy It For What It Is, But..."

670,"Psychologist Rolanda Mitchell had been kidnapped by a sheik!  She was supposed to be in Afghanistan to counsel soldiers; but, instead she was standing before a very handsome stranger who introduced himself as Shahryar with the request for her to tell him a story each night for the next one thousand and one nights.  What came as an even more of a shocker to Rolanda was that he knew her erotic romance writing pen name.Biding her time while planning her escape, Rolanda composed her first night's fiction entitled Positively Despotic...In the land of Frumos - where two brothers were bounded by magic, by birth and the love of one woman - as long as the triad was whole, the land would be peaceful and prosperous; however if it was to be broken only destruction and hostility would exist.  For a century, that bond had been broken by treachery and black magic - now the time had come for the current ruling brothers to find and unite with their special woman to restore tranquility and harmony throughout land of Frumos.The Alexandrescu's brothers Valentin and Dragos were perceived by the outside world to brutally take whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted.  Well, international reporter Kiana Davis was determined to discover if all the negative rumors surrounding the Alexandrescu brothers were true.  Kiana gained more than she bargained for when she discovered nothing was quite as it seemed.  What came as even more of a surprise was her strong attraction to both Valentin and Dragos and the brothers' insistence that she was the one to complete their triad.Author Shara Azod has managed to roll two fantastic stories into one with Positively Despotic.  The first couple, Rolanda and Shahryar, will remain a secondary focal point for the entire series of 1,001 Nights with Shara.  I was greatly intrigued by this couple.  Ms. Azod successful carved Shahryar into a great, sexy mystery that I am eager to discover more about.  Rolanda will definitely have to stay on her toes with him because I have a feeling that very soon she will be the star in Shahryar's bedroom scene long before her 1,001 nights' freedom come knocking at the door.However, the main plot revolved around a threesome couple.  Instant sparks flew and the flames burning hotly until the very end.  Even though the storyline took place over a couple of days, Ms. Azod still managed to craft a plausible, spell-bounding tale with incredible characters.  Valentin and Dragos were dominate, sexy and very charming alphas, while Kiana proved to be a strong, intelligent heroine.  Their sexcapades, whether as a twosome or threesome, were passionately erotic and frequent in nature.  All in all, Positively Despotic was fabulous read that I am sure many will enjoy.NikitaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1001 Steamy Nights

672,"The day her divorce is final, Elizabeth gets a call from the 2 men in her past that she's never been able to forget or get over. She knows they'll be in the small town she grew up and is returning to so she can give her daughter the same wholesome upbringing she had, but she thinks she can avoid them.Chandler and Hayden Scott (yes - brothers) made a big mistake 8 years ago when they told Lizzy she was nuts for having feelings for the both of them. They aren't going to make that mistake again and they aren't going to let her go.When they pick her up at the airport instead of her parents, she doesn't know what to think - then Hayden lays one on her that almost brings her to her knees. Chandler gets his turn to plunder her lips out in the parking lot and oh boy does he. The guys tell her that they want her and don't intend on giving up until they get exactly what they want.She thinks they're nuts and only saying all this out of some obligation to their parents being old good friends - but at the same time wishing it were all true. Lizzy kind of freaks out after the guys tell her that they've spoken with her parents already and the rest of the town.Hayden and Chandler want to marry her, they want to be fathers to her daughter and they want to have babies with her. After her horrible experience of being married to someone who cheated the entire time they were married and whom she didn't want to be married to to really begin with, she never wants to get married or have babies again. Evah.There's a break-in at her parents house, an attempt to get the blackmail evidence that she used to get out oh her marriage - of her husband and of her father-in-law senator cheating with numerous women - but the perps were unsuccessful.After some hot, hot lovin' out at the guys ranch, she gets a call from her ex. He says his mother will do anything it takes to get her grand-daughter back and the fact that she shacking up with two guys might allow them to do just that. Then he suggests the one thing she never wanted to do again - marry one of them. She does and they think all is fine. It's not.While on an errand into town, she gets flat and hitches a ride with one of the ranch hands. An assassin is in the back of the truck and knock hers out. She wakes up later, while the ranch hand is digging a hole under gun-point and hears the assassins plans for her and her daughter. He plans to kill her and take the little girl back to her grandparents. She escapes back to the ranch after being shot and the attackers are caught.The ex shows up and offers to relinquish rights tot he daughter he never really wanted to begin with so one of the guys can adopt her. He says it's the best legal way to her his parents off her back. Hayden then says he sent the incriminating evidence to the press as well. The senator and his wife go down and HEA.This story was ok. I think what I liked most about it was the guys. They were so determined to win her heart again. They were good guys too. I kind of didn't like Lizzy. She totally didn't hold to any of her personal goals and gave in so easily when the time came to do so. She also didn't believe the guys when they said they loved her and she thought she was entering a sham marriage. I felt bad for the guys actually - she treated them like dirt really. The sex sure was hot though.",Feirce cowboy lovin'!

674,"I started off reading this series out of order. I read Will's story first, book 3Heat of the Storm: An Out of Uniform Storyand then Ryan's story next, book 5Heat of the Night: Out of Uniform, Book 5, with Ryan's being my favorite out of these three. I'm glad I read those others before this one, as I think they are much better stories overall. While I enjoyed Heat of Passion, it didn't do as much for me as those other two stories did. Although it is a sexy read, it's not quite as hot. And I really felt more of a connection to Will and to Ryan, their characters being just more developed for me. Sure, Carson is sexy and sweet, but he just doesn't have that strong appeal or depth. Neither does Holly for that matter. I do think the writing and the series/stories are a lot better and sexier later on, having a bit more weight to them. This is a very quick read, nice but just not interesting or hot enough.",Nice

678,I had purchased a few digital books by Kate Pearce and this was the second book I read.  The erotic scenes in this book are unparalled.  The author flashes back to the heroine's misspent youth and time spent between/with two lovers who were twins.  Nothing could be much more taboo... The forbidden nature of the romance kept me turning the pages.  The sex scenes helped me to devour the book. My only complaint is that the novel just wasn't long enough.  I also was offended by the uncle's belief that a woman that can't bear children is kinda worthless.  But in the author's defense that was kinda par for the course for that time period.,Stayed up Overnight to read this book.
679,This book should not have gotten pass my erotica block - from the second chapter to the 6th(and that was all I could take)it was raunchy talk and explicited sex.  Not at all what I look for in a book.

684,"Plot:The only way to warm Kate after her car rolled into the river was naked between two hot cowboys. One thing leads to another and a hot and steamy snowed in weekend follows. But can it be for keeps?Comments:- 1833 kindle locations, but winds up around 1580.- m/f/m, m/f, m/m. Generous, lusty, fun, varied. No bdsm, toys or any other accessories. A different take on the m/m - they are cowboys who spend long winters together and don't mind helping each other out. But never saw themselves as a committed couple. While we start out as a fun menage for a few days, we end up aiming for a committed threesome.Opinion:Erotic contemporary cowboy menage with lots of revenge sex and a nice HEA. This is a nice little book but it isn't anything spectacular. It is disappointingly short, but it is complete. Nothing is left to be said. All plot strands are wound up. I like the ending, I like that Kate is given the opportunity to make an intelligent, considered decision (so unusual in these books!) and I like that it is simply a Naughty Weekend that just maybe takes us to Forever. There are no Bad Guys, no-one is Wounded, no Angst. We simply get lots of sex and then a HEA (with more sex *grin*). It is what it is.Aside:The m/m instance is a little more uncomfortable than I expected. I have read m/m where they are committed and ready and willing to go for it when the opportunity arises. It is natural. I have read m/m where at a point during the menage a decision is made to test the waters and hey! look at that! we like it. It's organic. But ""Saddled"" is a little different. More forced. The men aren't so willing to go down that path with Kate there (although they have in private). And the issue is somewhat taken out of their hands by the games they are playing. It changes the dynamic. No one is ""forced"" but IMO it gets a little grey and drops this from a low 4 stars to a high 3.-CR-","Hot nekkid cowboys, a few lost snowy days, and plenty of revenge lovin'.

690,"Kristan Hoffman describes her book by saying ""Think Sex and the City meets Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" I really love this description because it makes it clear that the book is about a group of close-knit friends. The thing I loved about `Twenty-Somewhere' is that it's set right after the girls (Sophie, Claudia and MJ) graduate from college. I haven't read that many books that take place during this time, so that made it interesting for me. Hoffman did a good job describing the girls' feelings as they deal with new homes, new jobs, new loves, and just a whole lot of new situations.While I really loved the concept (and even the plot) of the book, I had a hard time with the style of writing. For some reason the present tense really threw me off, and I had a hard time differentiating between characters at first. I never really felt like I got to know the characters all that well, perhaps because of the third person narration, but also because of the abundance of dialogue. The lack of lengthy descriptions and the short section breaks make `Twenty-Somewhere' easy to read and kept me turning the pages, but it also kept me from feeling totally involved with the characters.As this book won the St. Martin's Press ""New Adult"" contest it's clear that it has a lot of potential. If you're looking for something quick and easy to read that also contains humour and heartache, then `Twenty-Somewhere' might be for you. This book covers a topic which could be pretty heavy, but Kristan makes it light and funny, having her characters find strength in their new situations.",Humour & heartache

692,"Not sure what's going on with this series.  I was hoping for an improvement from the first book, expecting that the author was more-or-less catching his stride.  But this installment was a meandering series of seemingly random events with nearly zero plot development, and characters that really didn't go anywhere from the first book.I ask myself these three questions: What were the characters doing at the beginning of the book?  What were they doing at the end of the book?  Do I know more about what's going on than I did at the beginning, or was this just filler?  My answers were not promising.The main character himself is still an improbably young, impossibly over-skilled vengeance addict.A few deus ex-machina devices deliver the characters from certain doom on multiple occasions which make the story a little cartoon-buffoon-ish.I think the author here has a *lot* of potential.  I like the flow of the prose, and how I never hiccup over the words or phrasing as a reader.  I like the writing style, which is why I gave the second book a chance.  At some point in the future I may give this author another shot, but not in this series, as the benefit of my doubt has just run out.*** spoiler alert below ****** SPOILER ALERT BELOW ***- How is it that three people about to be beheaded can fight their captors, jump down from the execution stage and *run* to their horses under the cover of a distraction?

As someone who spent many summers at camp, I could put myself into some of the character's shoes and relate.  If you're looking for a good story, and something that to me is worth good value for the dollar sales price, this will be worth your time with an interesting story and characters.  The characters could have more development, and the author kind of left it open in the end with the possibility of a sequel which I would like to read if it is written.

697,"The Stranger by Elizabeth LaneHarlequin Historical # 856 - July 2007It's 1881 in the New Mexico Territory. Caleb McCurdy has just been released from a five year stint in a Yuma prison. He'd taken the fall for his outlaw brothers who'd tried to rob the bank and left him holding the horses. He'd paid for his participation, but his soul is tormented by the deeds of his brothers at the Shafton Ranch. Caleb owed a debt to the widow Shafton for the killing of her husband, something he had tried to stop. Laura Shafton remembers that evil day five years before in her nightmares. She'd lost her husband but she had her son, Robbie; the unborn child she'd been carrying. She's wary of strangers, so when Caleb knocks on her door to offer work for food, she greets him with a shotgun. While Caleb is mending her gate, Robbie seems to disappear, only to be found hiding in a tree. On his way down the boy falls breaking his arm, and Caleb helps Laura set the break and splint it. This builds a certain amount of wary trust in Laura and she allows Caleb to stay in her tool shed and continue to work for food. Caleb fears that at any time Laura's going to recognize him as the 17 year old who had accompanied those evil men, but he's matured a lot since then and his body has grown strong. Laura too is no longer the teenage bride; she's now a strong independent woman. Their attraction is something that Caleb fights; for he knows that should Laura ever find out who his is she'll never forgive him.I really liked the plot for this story. The characters are very well developed and easy to like. Though both Laura and Caleb are in their early 20's in this book, they've both lived a life time in experiences. Caleb has always been a good man, but he'd been misguided by his need for family, and so he'd stuck with his brothers. Laura is incredibly strong and resilient, almost over the top so. She'll survive anything in order to protect and care for her son. Though I found myself skipping over paragraphs because the pace seemed slow, this was a good book, one of forgiveness and healing","This was a good book, one of forgiveness and healing."

The story started out fairly strong and I liked the chemistry between the two characters but it just seemed to get dragged out ridiculously long and it just got sort of repetitive on the emotional/sexual beats. There was a lot of sexual content which I'm not opposed to but it wasn't the best written smut so it did get a little tedious at times. I wish there had been a bit more depth or complexities in the story and the characters themselves but hey smut is smut and that's pretty much what you're getting.

And what's even worse... then she moves to that same city where the other family lives, so her children can still be close to their dad. I have to tell you...that just blew my mind. Then it gets better yet, because this woman's brother is the one that ratted him out, and now her own brother is married to her ex-husband's, Kevin's, first wife. And what's even more weird, is that both of his ex-wives become best friends in the process. In fact they all seem to get along, both the children and the adults. I still really don't know how she did it, but....the Brenda Novak had a way of weaving this story around so well, that it really makes this story work some how.Like I said...there are so many major twists and turns in this story, that by the time I finished reading it, I thought I'd surely have a bad case of whiplash.

706,"""The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence.""Professor Pierre Arronax and his assistant, Conseil, join the crew of the Abraham Lincoln to chase down this strange ocean mammal that has been destroying ships. The duo, along with harpooner Ned Land, end up overboard and rescued by what is revealed to be a submarine, not a mammal. This submarine is captained by Nemo, a mysterious man who has eschewed the land in preference to roaming the open seas. Nemo takes the trio twenty thousand leagues across the seas - from the Pacific to the Indian to the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Along the way, Arronax uncovers bits and pieces about his captain and catalogs the various fish he sees.Jules Verne is basically the Father of Science Fiction. His novels - such as ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"" - were groundbreaking for their time. I'd go so far to say that if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have the science fiction genre at all.That said, this book was supremely dry and dull most of the time. Yes, it is ""hard science fiction"" with lots of attention to detail to the mechanics of underwater ""sailing"" (some of which is incredibly on the mark; others, such as the lamp lighting the way of the Nautilus, laughable and out-dated), but there comes a point when enough is enough. This is particularly prevalent when Arronax/Verne spends multiple pages describing the flora and fauna of the sea in intricate detail (""cataloging fish"" into their species and genus) or having long conversations with other characters about irrelevant history (such as the electric cable stretching from the Americas to Ireland).Again, I greatly appreciate the attention to detail and the thought Verne put into the operation of the Nautilus. That isn't my problem. And I don't mind some detail about the sights Arronax sees while traveling. But the latter in particular ""sinks"" the story. And when the story is as diluted and sparse as it is here, that is nearly a death warrant.The majority of this novel reads as a travelogue, Google Maps directions, an account of someone's rather dull vacation. While there are a few scenes that are particularly interesting (the journey to the Antarctic and nearly being trapped underwater, a way too short squid attack, and some walking underwater scenes), by far most of the book is cataloging fish or boring ""and on Mar 21st, we sailed from X in Y direction to Z"". Yawn. What makes this is even more ridiculous is that Arronax, Ned Land, and Conseil are supposedly held prisoner aboard the Nautilus, so they do not leave and divulge its secrets elsewhere, but no one seems to care about being held against their will until suddenly they are. I'd say ""Stockholm Syndrome"", only they give a half-hearted struggle when Captain Nemo tells them they are stuck on the ship. Based on how it is written and how little concern these characters have to their captivity, I don't know why Verne didn't just have Captain Nemo invite Arronax to journey with him and maybe decide that he didn't WANT them to leave.The only (and by far the best) character in this book is Captain Nemo. Sure, there is Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land, but calling them ""characters"" is a stretch, unless you are using the most generous of definitions of ""character"". Arronax is probably the best of the trio. He has some moments of humor (as a side note, there is quite a bit of humor, and it is well applied and a good break from the blandness of most of the text) and has a complicated relationship with Nemo. Ned Land would be next. His sole character trait is wanting to kill anything that moves - whales, kangaroo, tigers, you name it. Pretty much any time he appears in the story, it's to talk about wanting to kill something or escape (and honestly, he doesn't even CONSIDER escape until the last 75% of the novel). The absolute worst character, in my opinion, is Conseil. The guy makes Saltine Crackers look like they aren't bland. If you want a cold, blindly loyal servant, this is your man.But I hesitate to blame this lack of characterization on Verne's skill as an author or the standard ""But it's hard scifi, not a character study!"", particularly when you have the complex character of Captain Nemo. What the other characters aren't, Captain Nemo is. Apparently, something bad happened to his wife and his children - something bad enough to make him abandon the land all together and sail in his boat, enacting revenge on passing ships. But he isn't a cold blooded killer - he stays Ned Land's hand, when Ned wants to harpoon a bunch of whales for the hell of it. (Of course, not more than a couple of paragraphs later, Nemo then slaughters a bunch of ""sperm whales"", so calling the guy a hypocrite is definitely in order.)So the story is meh, the characters are meh, and the descriptions are overboard. Part of that is just me not really being that hot on the book (my dad, a retired Navy submariner, and my sister both ADORE this book and think I am mad for not). That's only a small part of ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"". The more important part - and the reason I think that any fan of scifi should read this book - is its influence on the genre. This is the great-great-great-great grandfather of novels like ""Ender's Game"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". So in that regard, this book is priceless - it gives me a better respect for the genre I love.Brought to you by:*C.S.

707,I found nothing to like in this short description of torture and murder. The idea that anyone can feel justify to take another's life for their own justice is disturbing. Adding torture for revenge just makes it worse. This story has nothing but very graphic violence that I found offensive and unpleasant.The only good things are a) it was free free and b) it will keep me from spending money on the Michael Sykova novels.,The First Kill did not entice
708,Lindsey is tired of being used by men so she swears off them until she meets Brad. Lindsey was offed a position to renovate a room for sex in a hotel. She has no limits on what she can do with the room. Lindsey is ready to create her ultimate fantasy and Brad is just the man to help her. He is hired to help with the construction portion of the room but one look at Lindsey and he would like to be renovating other things as well like her and him together. Brad has his own insecurities about woman and most people in general he has big dreams that he has never gotten any backing in. This is a great book to read about an in charge woman giving up control to a man who doesn't usually take it because he is not sure if he will be rejected. The are a great pare that burn up the pages and learn that if you open up just a little then true love an truly find you.,wow

What a great way to start a series-- &#34;vanilla, sweet girl&#34; meets SEAL with a reputation for being a ladies man and rumors of kink and threesomes. They lust after each other for a year without the other knowing - and that's when the story begins.  Shelby proves she is not as vanilla and John Garrett thinks by having a threesome with Garrett and his buddy, Carson.Definitely a wonderful love story and the characters are beginning to be developed. I assume they will be in future books in the series, I will feel let down if they aren't.  The sex scenes and descriptions are NOT for the innocent- Elle Kennedy doesn't hold back! Hot!","Too Short!!

I sometimes wanted them to just cut to the chase!

714,"65 Proof is a collection of short stories written by J.A. Konrath, aka Jack Kilborn. These stories run the gambit from good to mediocre and to some that just make you wonder about the psyche of Mr. Konrath. They are all fun to read. It was enjoyable to read the short stories featuring Jack, Phinneas and Harry. If you want to read something while waiting for a doctor's appointment or in between tv shows then this book has everything that  you could want to read; some are funny, some are intriguing, others will make you scratch your head.All I can say is it was a fun read, not great literature but definitely not boring. Enjoy",an insight into the psyche of Mr. Konrath :)
715,"I LIKE Erickson (Fortune's Deception: Fortune, Book 1is a particular favorite), but this book is just dull, dull, dull.  A bland female main who is suddenly somehow a vixen once she gets her cashmere twin set off and a weak daddy's boy ex-con male main who can't make up his mind.  Their instant attraction comes out of nowhere (which can be okay), but there is too much time spent with the weak and uncompelling plot (gangster wants a bracelet because it belonged to the widow of his boss?) and not enough time in the bedroom.  Even the sex scenes felt phoned in.Erickson has some really good stuff out there, but this novella is free for a reason.",Boring

Perhaps because it started with all the culture of werewolves in Malta instead of easing into it.Having been to Malta and waiting for more of it, I was bit disappointed hence couldn't get into it.

I enjoyed this story more than expected. Since it is part of an ongoing series, I was afraid I would be lost and confused, but I wasn't.

722,"This guy is a good writer. He has a good story going on and several time I found myself totally engrossed in the story and couldnt wait to get back to it. The books, all of them, need a good editor to read them over and make some adjustments to grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc, but honestly, if you are just wanting to read and can ignore the odd bits here and there, its a good series to pick up.",Good story - Needs a good editor
723,"I only recently discovered this author, having read one of her other stories which was a complete winner. This one, however, just didn't measure up.To be fair, the writer is very talented and, in terms of technique, is well above and beyond many of her contemporaries who are churning out e-books with glaring errors, inconsistencies and poor grammatical structure. My issue with this story was that the hero and heroine simply didn't engage my interest.The heroine seemed a rather insipid character and the hero was supposed to be an alpha male, but he just didn't dial up the heat for me. First, he's introduced with a beard (yuk! Though he does shed this soon after) and then he goes on to provide a pretty lacklustre performance for the heroine's first time (double yuk). Probably quite realistic, but not what you're looking for in this type of book.That aside, there is nothing too wrong with the storyline, which is why I still gave it three stars. Having said that, I ended up ditching it before three-quarter time.",It was a bit disappointing...
724,We love old stories like this & enjoy the read. It's a great read for me since school & kids definitely enjoy this.,A really good ole story!
725,"This story was originally published in an anthology, which partially explains the abbreviated feel that this short story has.We meet Wolfe (a wolf breed) and his mate, Hope. [Most stories/books in the series have titles that play off the names of one or both of the main pairing.]  It references/fleshes out a character comment made in one of the other books (""Coyote's Mate, I think) on how Wolfe and Hope's mating began.  Definitely reflects its placement early in the series canon timeline, and the animalistic nature of the Breeds.  Warning: not for the faint of heart, as the encounter is not sweet/romantic.","Okay short story, but not one of the best"
726,"Pip comes home after being away for 9 years.  Her long absence stemming from being publicly rejected and humiliated by our lovely hero Cowboy.  Through the course of the book, he continues to reject her.  And what does she do to this?  She shows up at his place.  Pip was just utterly pathetic.  Every step of the way she was chasing after him and I just didn't like it.  Honestly if a guy doesn't call after almost week, you move on.  Pip had so little self-esteem it was just painful to watch her get rejected and chase after a man who didn't seem to view her as much more than a hook up for 97% of the book.  It was as if she thought that was all she deserved from a man.It also bugged me he slept with, had a serious relationship with and almost married Pip's sister.  There are some nice interactions between Pip and her girlfriends and those are actually some of the best in the book but generally they come off as unrealistic.  Also the fact that in the universe of this book Cowboy being a bona fide manwhore is acceptable but Pip is considered a slut because she messed around a bit with a guy, that really rubbed me the wrong way.  Especially being it is the women calling each other sluts and whores.  Why in the world would an author put down women for being sexual beings when she is writing erotica where the readers are almost all women?Basically, if you want to skim this to read the sexy bits go for it, you won't be disappointed, but if you want a good story, devoid of cheesy dialogue, without hero who is a total jerk and a heroine who gets rejected and insulted and just comes back for more then this might not be the book for you.  2 stars.",pathetic heroine
727,"Although I read more paranormal romances than anything else, I really enjoyed this romance without any of the paranormal elements I'm used to.

I don't feel like everything was resolved. It needs a sequel!",Lovely Romance
728,"I received this as a freebie on another site a year ago. I quit reading after the first or second chapter. I found it hard to follow as it was part of a series, and there wasn't enough detail in the first chapter to give you a lot of groundwork - it seemed to assume you've read the previous books. By the time I quit reading, things were really just... not very believable. Not plausible at all, for a woman with an abusive former husband.",Eh
729,"Okay, I realize that what turned me off this book is extremely subjective, all reviews are subjective, but I think some points are less subjective than others, however this is how I feel in good faith.Everybody has a different suspension of disbelief threshhold and believe in fantasy I can suspend disbelief as to a lot of things. Unfortunately I wanted to roll my eyes once I realized that yes, blurb was actually correct. And yes, I bought it because I was curious enough to see if I can suspend disbelief. So I cannot blame anybody but myselfSo, no spoilers, since  all I reference is the blurb which is here is for everybody to see, but seriously, Ryland dear, the only way you can get money for your tuition is to agree to be thrown to werelions? I mean, seriously, honestly, fantasy is great, but author chose to write about very human educational institution, right? Um, go get a loan, go work in construction on weekends, go do something. Sorry, I want realistic interactions even in fantasy, I cannot tolerate much stupidity.Anyway, if you CAN suspend disbelief and just tell yourself that this is what author chose to do to throw leads together, the story is actually well written and hot in my opinion and this is is why I give it three stars and not one. I just wish that initial setup would have worked better for me, even if he would have decided to do so for fun, because he was bored, that would have still been more believable for me, but not because he felt he had no other choice and nowhere else to get money.

733,I was pleasantly surprised by the real-world perspective McCray brought to this story. The female lead demonstrates growth without being whiny and the male lead is developed with an interesting Native American flavor. Indian Moon will satisfy readers that enjoy romance but it also appears to other readers that crave more than just a love story. I found the theme of commercial development vs. environmental preservation interesting as well and that added yet another layer of interest for me as someone that does not typically read romance novels.And any book with both a Rob Zombie AND a Motley Crue reference in it are cool with me ;)This a great beach read. You won't be disappointed.,"Not your typical, syrupy romance..."
734,"Love it, as I have done the whole series yet. The fact that the author pen doesn't tremble to kill key characters is a breeze of fresh air... you never know what is gonna happen",Excelent start for the series at zero cost
735,"This wasn't a bad read, it's original in its concept, it's vampires that take over and pretty much try to decimate humans, but then a band of humans fight back, so I'd recommend it for anyone who digs vampire stories.",Not bad
736,"I'm not really sure what to say about Dead(ish); I almost feel bad giving it the score I did. There's things to like here; the concept is amusing (for the short form, girl gets murdered by boyfriend, hires a P.I. to help find her body, wacky hijinks ensue), the writing style and voice are clear and entertaining, and the technical aspects of the work are well done.Why only two stars, then? Primarily because it feels disjointed, and a trifle incomplete. Scenes just sort of happen, with little rhyme or reason. There's one point that the dead woman is &#34;teasing&#34; the PI in the shower, seemingly with no better explanation than &#34;because reasons!&#34; There's several sequences featuring an almost painfully flaming gay man that, while perhaps funny, seem almost ridiculously overblown when compared to the relative down-to-earth tropes and characterization of the other players. The boyfriend-slash-murderer also manages to land himself in the unbelievable category, apparently having a secret gay side, huge amounts of debts and bizarre culinary skills that are never explained and clash with the manner of presentation.Overall, I think it's the illogic of the thing that bothered me the most. To me, for something to be humorous - which Dead(ish) seems to be attempting - it has to make sense, by it's own rules and logic if by no other judgement... and Dead(ish) seems to fall short on that score. With a bit more content - filling in some of the blank spots, detailing the character motivations and backgrounds a bit more - I'd say there's enough spark here to warrant at least 3 and perhaps a 4 star rating. But it's not quite there, yet.Also, final warning - and one that's echoed on Amazon's page - but there's a boatload of foul language and obscure Aussie slang in here, so be prepared if such things are not on your &#34;okay&#34; list, or be prepared to do some websearching to sort out the slang.","An interesting concept, but could use some fleshing out."
737,"Good writing but not his usual genere. A little predictable characters, strong silent man with a loss, pretty heronine, bad guys. Good descrtiptions of scencery.",Ok
738,"There is a lot of jumping around - which I don't mind if it ends up pulled together.  Much did not.  This was more stream of consciousness writing and did not flow real well or in cogent manner plot wise.  Perhaps some of that is genre related (I can admit - noir is not my normal bag) .There are a lot of editing issues (missed words /punctuation) .  The randomness without back story of the characters lets much hang.  Description without fleshing out of characters was also disappointing.  Although (I have said this before) some may be related to length and it being prohibitive to such.  I just find it frustrating when there is real meat to a story, but it just ends without going through the paces set forth initially.  There is so much potential for this were it run through its paces as a full novel (or even novella) .  This felt (as I read) unique voicewise and plotwise.  It just never delivered - even becoming predictible in some parts.  There were just too many plot devices started and /or hinted at without development.I would have rated one star for reasons stated above - the save was the wry voice of the writer - which garnered two stars alone.Not recommended if you are a reader for whom pacing and story completion (other than with just ""there done because I end it here "") are important.  Recommended if you are looking for something different to read from a writer with a good voice.  I would try another from this author provided it is a bit longer to ensure (hopefully) full story development.  The writer has the goods - just needs to show the stamina.Cbristine",middle of road for me...

I thought it was because since I got it free on the Kobo-PC and their backgrounds are white that the eye strain was keeping me out. So I went ahead and bought the Kindle edition. Nope.

743,"I thought this was a somewhat unique twist on the reluctant wolf bride theme (though maybe I just don't read a lot of the hunter books).  Syd's never felt in tune with her hunter father, who is a major redneck bully werewolf hunter (hey, I'm from the mountains, I can say that).  She falls for a wolf, of course, who sees her and knows she's his mate. There is quite a bit of humor, actually, which really carries this story, I think.  Spoiler: Daddy forces hunk and daughter on some hunts which are funny and scary, and ultimately girl turns into wolf, Daddy tries to lock her up and &#34;cure&#34; her, almost kills the hunk, a gay wolf friend, and a cross-dressing pseudo-psychic.  In the end, Daddy comes only halfway round, and our heroine runs off with her hunk to have wolf pups.  Honestly, I kinda wondered if the author wasn't making more of a point about prejudices and homophobia than writing a steamy romance.  Not that I mind.  It was fairly well-written and funny and the plot moved well.  The talking dog bit was rather cumbersome, though.  Overall, not bad for the price.  I might check out others in this series if the price is right.",Howling
744,"This review covers BOTH volumes 1 and 2, from the Kindle editions.  I bought them as some olf my first Kindle books, asthey were very cheap.  But. they were long and porrly written.The books open with a straight forward tale of Maggie finding an ancient buried tablet which may yield ancient treasure and reveal much history.  She contives to steal the tablet and conduct the search herself.  Thus far, we have an action and intriguing story like Clive Cussler's tales.But then, the story just keeps getting more afield, weirder, including an attempt to place Maggie as the new Princess of Mexico. Interspersed through much of this is the historical tale of La Malinche, from 500 years before.  Frankly, after reading some of it, I lost interest and just skipped those portions.In short, I find this long, long tale quite unsatisfying.  It rambled, didn't make much sense, and the characters didn't interest me, nor the history.  One off-putting thing for me was the extensive conversations about sex (especially by the women) but no actual sex scenes or romance at all.  NOT recommended.The Kindle editions (bought early April 2009) had many typos, grammatical errors, and some formatting problems. In short, the editing was poor and incomplete.  I saw on some posting that this may have been corrected, but beware.","Weird, confused, poorly written."

746,"Coombes Woods by L.C. Hinsley begins with the Izzy indecisive struggle with signing the papers now or later.  We come to learn that she, with her 13 year-old son Connor, has recently (and secretly) left her husband.  This is her second partnering, as her first was with Connor's biological father.The opening interchange with the Housing Council's Mrs. Roberts really showed Izzy as someone who's uncomfortable with making sudden or rash seeming decisions. However, she doesn't want her hesitation to best her either.  This is supported later with her expressed regret to Alana that she should have left her husband years ago.At the end of this transaction, the mystery of Coombe's Woods begins:  Why was Mrs. Roberts staring?  What was with the ornate walking cane?  Izzy has seen it before, but where?Later as Izzy's back story is divulged to the reader, the memory of the cane returns to her: Connor's dad had one similar to it and he was also from Cedham (where they've just moved to).  Now we know that something deliciously interesting could be in the mix.I'm a fan of the story so far.The writing, however, did stall in places with an overload of redundancy.  Some of it may have been necessary to convey a message to the reader, but using it as a tool too many times becomes, well, redundant.  I felt the following portions were examples:~To take the flat now or not...in Mrs. Roberts office.  In the end it seemed a good use to demonstrate Izzy's character.~The scene with writing on Connor's room's wall.  I know that this was to hit a point home, but I felt it played a little too long.Lines of comment:~'Izzy half expected an onion to be pulled from the desk drawer... Eat this apple, she'd say.'  I liked this one.  Plays into the whole theme.~'Take care in the woods. That's what that odd woman had said.' Followed by a description of what Izzy sees outside.  While I like the mini-scene, it would work better to have Izzy 'see' first then have that cause her recollection.Just nitpicks really.Overall, I like the originality of the story's premise and the author's writing is clever and engaging enough to keep my interest.  I hope to read more.","Enjoying the Story, Writing Stalls a Bit"

750,"Love the whole idea of a deaf werewolf, who had no idea that she was a werewolf! Sad to say that the story didn't live up to my expectations. Robyn was a little too accepting of learning that not only are werewolves real, but that she's a werewolf too! And oh yeah, hunky stranger is destined to be her mate so it's okay to sleep together immediately. Sure she was surprised at first by the werewolf thing, then it was all no big deal. Um, really? I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure I would need a little more time to process all that new information!I had a few other problems with the story, aside from Robyn's easy acceptance. The issue of her being deaf wasn't really addressed. Apparently she's a champion lip-reader and surprise! As mates, Robyn and Keil had no problem communicating. Really? Wouldn't being deaf be more of an obstacle? It was almost a non-issue, like the color of her hair or what she did for a living. I was sort of looking forward to it being a more interesting aspect of the story. And while Robyn started out as a strong, self-sufficient woman, that part of her seemed to disappear once she found her man.Aside from being a short read (less than 100 pages), I found myself skimming the sex scenes. The author used a few words that I just don't like and don't think belong in writing. I might be a prude, but I don't like sex scenes using offensive (to me) language. And does anyone really talk like that during sex? Outside of bad movies, I don't think so! Really ruined that part of the story for me.Gave this one a 2/5 as I liked the premise and thought it was an original idea, but it was too short, problems were too easily solved, and it had some offensive (to me) language.

But it sure didnt bother him having sex with her right in front of the ""hidden"" camera in their motel room, as a distraction.The story had no build up. I was total BS and boring.

754,"The plot idea was interesting, but it was poorly executed. The characters were unrealistic and underdeveloped.

756,"Described as ""a collection of short stories told from a different character's involvement and point of view,"" this is actually a linnear novella in which the POV changes from chapter to chapter. None of it was particularly great. Just a very surface description of some bloody conflict between the seelie and unseelie courts during a fancy ball, with almost no background, engaging characterizations, or engaging dialogue.I acquired this some months ago, and in the meantime Farrell has released a novel based on it, entitled Soul. I believe it was only after the publication of Soul that this shorter work began to be listed as a ""Prequel companion"", and it's not exactly that, as the events described in it mirror events that take place in Soul.In my opinion, having now read two novels and two ""short story collections"" (one of which actually was a short story collection!) by Farrell, as well as the first chapter of Soul, perhaps Farrell should stick to novels. The longer format provides the obviously-needed room to develop interesting characters. One Night with the Fae lacks in this area, and pretty much reads like an author's outline for a longer work.",Meh

758,"I read this a while back and really enjoyed it. This is firmly in the erotic romance category, so people who are not looking for a very explicit tale will not enjoy this story.""Pearl"" is about a recently married couple. The husband has spent a lot of time at sea and a lot of time exploring his desires. He wants his wife very much, but he presumes she is too much of a lady to enjoy bondage or anything other than the most routine bedroom activities. His wife, having witnessed the games of others, would very much like to branch out, but is unable to communicate this to her husband. Then, there's a business trip, the discovery of a secret room, and the discovery of the discovery of the secret room. Also, the discovery of naughty sketches and the discovery of the discovery -- well, you get it.If you're looking for a short tale with a focus on the erotic between a married couple and containing loving dominance, this would most likely be a worthwhile selection. An excellent choice for when you're not looking for a complicated plot or are overloaded on a lot of serious non-fiction.",Erotic Take on Bluebeard Tale

There was a bit of a story, but not much. But if your in need of a hard-core get-in-the-mood book with BDSM and menage, this may be for you.Craig is a professor, and Jessica is his student. She has been flirting with him all semester, and he has been hiding behind the podium in order to cover his non-stop erection. But he knows, being his student, she is off limits. But after the last class, he walks in his office, and she is there, on his desk, completely naked!Craig sends Jessica to his house to cook him dinner, then takes her immediately into some fairly hard core BDSM for a newbie.

760,"Aidan is a futuristic transport pilot on the hook for her brother's gambling debts. Warwick is masked muscle for a corrupt businessman as he saves up for the revenge of the death of his parents. When they meet up, sparks fly and worlds tremble.Icy Heat isn't going to win any ""best written book ever"" awards, but I really liked it. And I don't usually like or read futuristic sci/fi novels. Definitely character driven, this story is way more about the people, Aidan and Warwick, than it is about world building or plot development - and that's okay. I wasn't expecting it to be heavy in those areas. But what it IS is surprisingly GOOD with the characters.Aidan is a control freak and has a history of not caring at all for physical contact. She's got a deep love and sense of obligation for her brother Zach, who is addicted to gambling and racking up big debt. I like that she's strong and smart without being a total bitch, and I was actually impressed with a particular scene in which she has to deal with the reality of killing a man. It wasn't focused on for long, but that there was any thought at all given to the complex emotions such an action stirs up, however accidental the killing, was a surprisingly fresh change on the kick-ass and almost conscienceless killer heroines of most urban fantasy/sci fi stuff I read.Warwick is scarred and damaged from those scars, keeping his face and body hidden as his cold heart and colder life is given over to exacting revenge on the man responsible for his parents death and the scars he keeps hidden. When he meets Aidan and starts to spend time with her, his vulnerability shines through and makes him eminently likable. He really is what made me like the story as much as I did. The childlike confusion and wild hope when Aidan accepts him, scars and all, was so endearing.There were huge gaps in the plot and I would've loved more definition in the world building, more glimpses of Aidan's and War's past, but it's a short book, more novella length, and for what's there, I was satisfied that the core of the story was well represented. It also had quite a nice mix of action and danger that was pretty deftly written. The sex scenes were steamy, too! All in all, a pleasurably satisfying, if not extraordinary read.",Fast and Fun Light Read

She flies the straight and narrow and can't remember the last time she did anything fun or risqu&eacute;.  Not the type of person to draw attention to herself, Briony knows that the hidden attraction she feels for two of her students is totally wrong and refuses to explore her feelings.

Avery sends a message to Alex requiring him to assist Caitlin and to let her interview and observe police officers for a week.  Alex hates it, but he grudgingly allows it.  He takes her to lunch.  They begin to fall for each other.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I don't recommend it.  It's not nearly as good as her other books.  There are two stories going on, and both are lacking.  The first story is the relationship between Alex and Caitlin.  There is too much pondering and inaccurate assumptions.  Caitlin assumes things which are not true but cause her distress.  A major separation happens because Alex is commitment shy.  It just wasn't interesting.  The second story is about catching the crook Ratso, described below.CAUTION MINOR SPOILER:With evidence from Ratso they can put away major criminal Lopez.  The first time they catch Ratso he tells them he has to go to the bathroom, and then he escapes out a tiny window.  The second time they catch him, he tells a policeman that the cuffs are too tight and hurt.  So the policeman stupidly removes the cuffs.  Then Ratso does something bad.  I was irritated at the cops' stupidity.  And then we don't know if Ratso was wounded or killed or was able to give evidence or what.

Portions had me thinking of Canada while other descriptions made me think of places in Wales and Scotland.

The basic premise was interesting and the characters had potential but they just felt a little flat within the constraints of the format.I think the backstory was the best part--however the way the two characters came together here, well not as riveting.  Sort of a Big Misunderstanding idea that was relegated to the background, while the present day Resolution  was a little more like an afterthought.  But in this case the afterthought is what we are reading.  There was also a brief foray into what could have been a I-Am-Man-See-Me-Protect...but it was a false alarm.

Lissa Matthew's came out with a book called Masked and mentioned on her blog that one of the main characters, Thor, was in this book. So after I finished Masked, I pulled this book out of the archives to read it once again.Aidn is a much sought after Dominant in a local club called Abyss. After a traumatic split with a submissive years ago, he only takes on trainees and one-night submissives. But he has come to realize he is bored with the same things and vanilla just isn't for him any more. Unfortunately, he has a hard time reconciling this with himself.Bailey is coming into her own. After not being able to work out her marriage, she has divorced and started her own bakery business. She knows Aidn from causal meetings at the Abyss, but never thought of him seriously knowing his reputation. When he approaches her outside of the lotion shop she can't believe he wants to have sex with her. She is comfortable with herself, but she knows not everyone is into larger women.They have a steamy afternoon in her place above the bakery. From the counter-top to the bed, they both believe this is just a one time affair, but Aidn gets the feeling she is the submissive for him and runs in fear. This is the theme for the story. She is ready to accept her submissive side and knows Aidn is the one, but Aidn can't let go of the past and continues to leave her several times during the course of this novella.While I understood why he had a hard time with what happened with his ex, it is no different from someone who gets a divorce.

777,"First book in ""Cannon Pack"" series. Followed byDance on the Wilde Side.Plot:Sydney's family are ""Hunters"" - they hunt werewolves (Shifters).

When the embodiment of her dreams, Jason, saves her from being eaten by a vicious treadmill, her life (and his!) is never going to be the same.Comments:- Quite a long book (5074 kindle locations).- Bedroom scenes are spicy rather than erotic (not particularly frequent), all m/f with constant references to gay friend and cross-dressing.- It is a different/original take on the human/Shifter relationship (redneck hunters vs suited Shifters), with lots of story and plot.- When I picked up this book, it was on some sort of promotion and thus $0. It isn't now. However, as stated by another reviewer, the cost of the book doesn't really affect my view of the book. Either it's good or it isn't. And because cost fluctuates, it is unfair to judge it based on price.Opinion:This book is quite funny, and enjoyable, however I didn't like it enough to search out Book 2. The characters are strong and interesting enough but the book could have been half the size and still covered the same material.

786,"If the first entry into the series was a toddler's first clumsy attempts at walking, then the second book in the Bewitching Mysteries series shows that the books are quickly maturing into a series worth reading.The plotline of this book has Maggie plunged headfirst into yet another murder mystery in her hometown. When the high school's resident mean girl turns up dead no one is quite sure where to look. The high school sweetheart? The lovestruck friend? Or is it someone completely unexpected? In any case expect a good dollop of witchcraft and slight hints at romance.Overall I really liked the series. There's one or two things that could be changed, most noticably the romantic triangle. It's painfully obvious that Marcus is interested in Maggie (and not dating Liss). It's even more obvious that Tom is not right for Maggie- their romantic scenes just come across as awkward and the reader can't help but wonder when Maggie will realize that she's dating the male equivalent of her mother & sister. For that matter I can't help but wonder if this is all going to pay off in a future book when Maggie FINALLY realizes that she can be her own person without running away or alienating her family. (I.E., her breaking it off with Tom is the defining moment when she realizes that she doesn't have to put up with people telling her how she should live her life or being condescending.) That's pretty much the only big thing that is flawed so far in the series. I know that Alt's probably saving it for some big scene later on in the series, but I can't help but get a little frustrated and impatient. It's just a bit tedious. In any case Alt needs to trim the dead weight (Tom) out of the series & either make him less condescending (making him a more believable romantic possibility) or downgrade him to an occasional character.4.8/5",Steadily getting better!

After about the fourth time of having to re-read a sentence because six or more words [sometimes correctly hyphenated, sometimes not] were used instead of the one perfect adjective, I stopped.Seemed like the characters might have been interesting and likeable but I couldn't get far enough into the story to comment on much else.",Is there such a thing as over-writing?

She's heard the rumors about them sharing women and is trying very hard to convince herself that she isn't interested in the two of them - together.Jon and JT have no qualms about their lifestyle or the fact that they want to make Christina a part of it.  The problem is that she's so skittish that getting close to her has been impossible - until now.  They've enlisted the aid of her friend Aislinn to help make Christina more comfortable with them.Aislinn is aware of Christina's aversion to men and alcohol but she also knows Jon and JT well enough to know that neither man would hurt her and judging by Christina's relaxed demeanor when the men are around she knows it too.  Since Christina isn't about to trust any man enough to start a romantic relationship, Aislinn suggests she indulge in a fling - just to get them out of her system.Christina follows her instincts and allows herself to be seduced into Jon and JT's bed for a sexual encounter she'll never forget.  Hours later she's awaken by the ringing of her cell phone only to receive the devastating news that her mother has died.  Christina's positive her father's abuse is what killed her mother.  Neither man will allow her to contend with her family alone.  Christina is going to have to come to grips with her feelings for them and learn to trust them - with her heart and her well-being.  She just may learn that there are some men who are not a complete waste of skin!Annmarie McKenna's THE STRENGTH OF THREE is more than a smoldering romance, it's a glimpse into the lives of children brought up in abusive homes as adults.  I really have to admire Christina for not only having the strength to stand up to her father and brother but for being brave enough to give Jon and JT a chance.  She's obviously afraid of history repeating itself but figures a fling with Jon and JT is safe enough.  Jon and JT are wonderfully alpha male and so intent on winning Christina's trust that it makes you smile just reading about them.  As for Christina's father and brother, well you'll love to hate them and the situation that led to Christina's mother's death.  Plus I have to tell you I got a real kick out of JT and Jon kidnapping Christina's guard dog to bring it to their home so she'd feel safer with them.

She thought she'd been successful at exorcizing him from her heart but his appearance at the Margarita Andresen Foundation fundraiser proves that she's still in love with him.  She's as much in love with him now as she ever was, but there's no way she's going to put herself through the pain of trusting him with her heart again.  Not even for the sizeable donation he's offering for her undivided attention while he's in New York.Demetrius Vartolas is a proud man who's well aware he made a huge error when he accused Crystal of cheating on him three years ago.  His jealousy got the better of him and he spoke without thoroughly examining the evidence and lost the woman he loves.  While he'd like nothing better than for Crystal to welcome him back with open arms, reality is that he hurt her and if he hopes to have any chance of rekindling their relationship he'll have to use any opportunity open to him - and her dedication to the Foundation proves to be the most convenient way to ensure she spends time with him.Crystal's stunned when she notices Demetrius's appearance at the Foundation's fundraiser.  Because of his status as one of the world's wealthiest and most eligible bachelors his presence at any event guarantees it to be a success but that doesn't make the situation any more tolerable for Crystal.  With a bit of champagne for courage she hopes to make it through the evening unscathed.  Unfortunately that isn't to be because she's soon confronted by Demetrius's partner and best friend Makis Stratus who always seems to be just paces away from Demetrius's side.  She's never trusted the man and his superior attitude has only cemented her dislike of him.Demetrius's timely interruption of her verbal sparring with Makis could be construed as a blessing or disastrous since she's now forced to acknowledge his presence and the feelings she still has for him.  When Demetrius offers to donate whatever is needed to secure the foundation's finances for the next five years in exchange for her undivided attention for a few days Crystal's sorely tempted to take him up on the offer.  If he already believes her to be untrustworthy and unfaithful why would he want to spend any time at all with her?  For Crystal, it's a simple matter of reveling in the passion they once shared, but as her feelings are brought to the surface so are questions about the `proof' of her infidelity.  How will she react when she uncovers the truth behind the `evidence?'Brandi Michaels certainly doesn't mince words in her short story JEALOUS LOVER.  Crystal and Demetrius's engagement was ripped apart by jealousy and insecurities but it's obvious that there's still a lot of love between them.  This story is sexually charged and intense right from the beginning but there are plenty of emotional connections that allow readers to enjoy every aspect of this couple's relationship - whether fighting or loving.  Ms. Michaels delves into the heartache over a broken engagement and betrayal and brings readers a story that will leave them smiling.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",4.5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies

Since the author seems to be an e-book self-publisher, this is a note to her: please find an editor.I'm an avid reader - and an English major. The title of the book alone horrifies me. ""The Mountaineer's (Alexa's Travel's)""?  What you're looking for is ""The Mountaineers (Alexa's Travels)"".I'm delighted that e-publishing expands the number of available stories, and gives new authors a better chance at publication. But I'm noticing more and more that these books are poorly edited, if they're edited at all. And if the TITLE of the book contains *two* punctuation mistakes...this is not a good trend.","To the author: please find an editor, stat!"
794,This is first story in the series Robert St.Clare is given a gift of a slave girl for the two weeks he will be visiting there.When she is brought to him the first night he finds she is an English girl and he knows her father. They have sex and more sex every night while they are being watched through peep holes. He wants to take her home with him but it is hard to talk and make plans with everyone listening. They do get to leave together you are not sure at first if it will happen. They have a brief seperation but the HEA does happen. Each story will be the man telling how he met his wife.A very enjoyable series.

I kind of felt the other women should have fought harder or something...no wonder they treat them so abominable. While I understand our heroine unable to help them, I really wish something thought out to end. Definitely a slow progress. I am glad these two found each other. They are good together.

This story has romance,  adventure, a new way of looking at Knighthood; it has everything you could want in a fantasy adventure story.This is the first story I have read by this author, and I have to say she going on my must-buy list.

803,"Inside one of London's most exclusive clubs several gentlemen gather once a month to visit with one another.  As a diversion, Jonas Maxim suggests they each reveal their most daring sexual exploits.  After all, they are men and sex is one of their favorite subjects.  The Earl of Grayson requests the opportunity to be the first to share his tale...Robert St. Claire, Earl of Grayson is stunned with the Sultan's gift of a beautiful slave to see to his carnal needs during his visit.  He's not exactly comfortable with this unorthadox practice.  To further complicate matters, Robert learns that the woman meant for his pleasure is no ordinary slave girl.  She's English and the daughter of a friend.  If he has any chance of freeing her, he'll have to avail himself of her many charms and pray that the Sultan will allow him to take her with him when the time comes for him to leave.Lady Celia Davenport had been the belle of London society.  Then she was abducted, sold into slavery, and expected to pleasure a guest of the Sultan's is most overwhelming to her gentle breeding.  When she discovers that the man she is to service is English and knows her father, she is great relief.  She now has a smidgen of hope of being able to return home but only if she is submissive to Robert's desires and pleases him. Otherwise she may be lost to the harem for the rest of her life.Each night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.Fortunately Robert is a very skilled lover and goes out of his way to ensure that Celia enjoys each of their sessions just as much as he does.  After their first night together, the Sultan gifts Celia with four perfect pearls - one for each time the esteemed guest found satisfaction inside her body.  Over the two weeks that Robert is a guest, his feelings for Celia grow while he worries about the future. Will he be able to successfully rescue her from a lifetime of slavery in the harem?  If so, how is he going to explain all this to her father?Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB series is off to a brilliant start with this gem of a tale.  ARABIAN PEARL satisfies that wicked fantasy that many women have of being kidnaped and thrust into the life of a harem girl while still retaining a sense of independence and a hope for freedom.  I love how Celia changes throughout the storyline - she goes from a shy virgin to a self confident young woman who rejoices in her own sexuality.  Robert's blatant adoration of Celia really endears him to me.ARABIAN PEARL captured my interest from the very first page and held me enthralled right to the end.

804,"I recently got into reading period mysteries with the Maisie Dobbs series. After finishing them, I read ""Her Royal Spyness"", which I found to be frivolous and shallow by comparison, so I figured I'd try the Lady Julia Grey bundle, based on the reviews. I was not disappointed. The stories are interesting, with some good plot twists. I wouldn't really call them romances, although they do have a romantic undercurrent, and the dark character of Nicholas Brisbane grows on you after awhile. Lady Julia is a bit too impetuous, but she is a good foil to Brisbane, and I enjoyed the setting of Victorian England.

810,"I thought the 3rd book in the Men of S.W.A.T. series to be sexy and fun, but not without its problems.  It took a while for me to like a hero who could humiliate our heroine as he did when they were teenagers, then enter into a long-term relationship with our heroine's ""prettier"" sister. There was a good opportunity for Cowboy to redeem himself, but Pip didn't make him work for her or her forgiveness! I didn't think it was very hero-like of Cowboy to take Pip's virginity on the ground behind his truck. And the end was so very frustrating!So why did I give this one 3 stars? The sexual tension was hot, and it features one of the most hilariously funny scenes I've ever read!

Oh yeah, and then there is the fact that the scout ship needs an engineer in the engine room, that the engines have to open up for firing, and a whole other range of things that are not at all founded upon science, such as the simple fact that the spaceship should have been decelerating prior to the arrival at the planet. [[END SPOILER ALERT]] This story seems to be like most science fiction that is being written today, almost worthless.Story neither interesting nor innovative enough to get me to buy the other three novels in the trilogy...And a word on the cover art.

820,"Charity Harris has had enough of the little game she and Gabriel have been playing for several years.  They shared one sexual encounter eight years ago that was less than satisfying but that hasn't stopped her from obsessing over him.  Somehow she just knows that they could be so good together - if Gabriel would just unleash the beast lurking beneath his nice guy exterior.Gabriel Bettencourt likes sex rough and hard and he's positive that Charity is too sweet to be able to handle his needs.  It was holding back that had caused that night eight years ago to be so unsatisfactory.  She's exactly the sort of woman he'd want if it wasn't for the little issue of his sexual tastes.  He's in for quite a surprise because Charity isn't going to continue to allow him to pretend indifference where she's concerned.With Christmas just around the corner Charity's pulling out all the stops and going after the man she's been in love with for longer than she cares to remember.  From an early age their mother's had them paired up together and with so much in common - their Portuguese heritage and sense of family values being a big plus - they do make the perfect couple.  Everyone around them recognizes their attraction to each other and their playful innuendos aren't kidding anyone.  With the aid of a little red sweater and a little too much Jose Cuervo she confronts Gabriel and even though he doesn't admit to his true feeling for her the kiss they share after he drives her home leaves no doubt that she gets to him.  Of course he pulls the gentlemanly act and leaves her sexually frustrated because he's not going to take advantage of an intoxicated woman.  Good thing Charity doesn't give up easily and she's got a fiery temper that will serve her well while dealing with Gabriel and his convoluted thinking where she's concerned.Lauren Dane does it again.  SWEET CHARITY encompasses everything I've come to love in Ms. Dane's novels.  The characters are down to earth, loveable, and absolutely delightful to get to know.  Charity's ballsy confrontations with Gabriel left me snickering and a little in awe of her bravado.  Gabriel's protective instincts and preference for BDSM loving left me drooling.  One of the things I loved about this story is how much the characters treasure their families and their heritage.  Add how perfect Charity and Gabriel are for each other without even realizing it really warms the heart.  Of course, Charity's fiery temper had me laughing out loud because sweet she definitely isn't once riled.

821,"Whoah Mamma! I found a new author and her name is Kinsey W. Holley! Can you believe this was just a random kindle download from the recommended section? I can't, maybe I should pay attention to those more often? This hot little PNR had everything a paranormal junkee could ask for: Hot sexy werewolf Alpha, tough, but slightly tilted heroine, great writing, interesting back-story, cool shifter dynamics...and the potential to grow. Ms. Holley, no rush or anything, but can I have some more?REVIEW: Incest is best...put your sister to the test. I think that was like some stupid phrase in grammar school or something. Lark and Taran call themselves cousins, but Taran is more like an older brother since Lark actually lived with his mother after her parents died. Technically they are not related at all, but that still doesn't make Lark feel better about her hot fantasies that she has about Taran and the flame that she has been holding for him for like, ever.When Lark gets herself in a bit of trouble with some Euro wolves, a little GHP and an attempt on her life, Taran, who is now a Houston PD detective takes it upon himself to protect Lark. Close quarters and heated emotions might play a little too much for them though, as secrets come out - and hidden feelings are revealed.Can I get a Taran of my own? Yum. This was definitely a fun and entertaining read. I am a fan of both the hero and heroine and all that went along with them. The book kept me glued throughout, not one dip into boredom with this one. Great thing about the kindle on my iPhone - reading in the line picking up the Drama Queen, reading at the football game, reading at the line in the grocery store...reading while I'm doing that web upload at work. Couldn't put it down. My only niggle in the negative about this one was the ending - and I'll try to keep this spoiler free. There was a bit of an unresolved conflict, I wanted to see the outcome of a particular plot thread, which never happened. At least a quick epilogue that tidied everything up. That's it, though, wasn't that big of a deal. The main feature was resolved, so that is all that mattered.RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, a lot of happy coupling. PNR fans, werewolf fans should enjoy. While a werewolf book, the paranormal elements are not over-powering, it would be a good contemporary to PNR transition book.",A Sexy Story Indeed!

She returns to her hometown as a good girl while he goes back undercover working the drug case.

However, both share the same mission of finding the cold blooded killer who murdered her brother and his police partner.OUT OF CONTROL is fast-paced in the bedroom, the race track and several places in between as Jack and Alex prove the body can go from zero to ninety in nanoseconds.  The police procedural romance is filled with suspense and tension as each investigates related homicides until they team up as he fears she will be next if she remains OUT OF CONTROL; that is outside his touch.

She needed some hobbies or she needed to use her college degree . As for her hiding her past from her husband of seven years a past that wasn't even all that scandalous was ridiculous to me.

In between assignments they live in a remote cabin waiting for the next call, during the time they stay there they see a cougar, one theyve come to call their pet.Kaya, Hunter and Jericho create a romance that is unique, when the men leave on a call its supposed to be only for a few weeks at the most, but things go wrong and the men get hurt leaving a pregnant Kaya to defend for herself thinking she was abandoned.My Opinion: The story was touching to read and well written, surprisingly the 3way relationship wasnt an issue it was just another part to the story.",Shape-Shifter romance

I have the same complaints that I had previously - wooden Kate, semi-one dimensional Caton, sophomoric love scenes, lack of tension.

I usually don't read the book synopsis since spoilers lurk, but this time, I would have been well-served.  While human trafficking is deplorable and a reality, my interest flagged from the start.  Details followed details about the Triad, the Tong, and no suspense built at all.  I found no one to root for, no one to despise, since the characters were thrown out there with no real feeling to them.  I'm sorry to give this series a miss since there are five more....  I am usually enthralled with continuing characters and thrilled to have a long series.  Not this time.

835,"By halfway through the book, I no longer knew just what the hero's mission was and a bit further on, I no longer cared. More simply, the author introduced multiple generations into the crime scenario so that neither the reader nor the hero was ever particularly clear as to just what the point was. If there was a point. There is a difference between complexity and confusion; the book reflects the latter far more than the former. There is also a problem, never resolved: linking the multiple murders and cases of mayhem, with a single thread as the denouement seeks to do. It never really gels in literary terms nor in terms of a satisfying conclusion.The book does have its virtues in the development of some of its characters and their traits, as well as in the creation of a sense of the confusion the only solution to which requires that the hero keep plugging along through a fog of deceit.Overall, not a book I can unconditionally recommend or condemn. I would not put myself into a situation in which this was the only thing I had to read with more than a few hours of journey ahead. There is too good a chance it won't satisfy to rely entirely on its merits for your reading pleasure; keep something else on reserve---just in case.",Decent Though Too Diffuse Read

838,"~* 3.5 Stars *~It's innocent, if slightly indecent fun. About as indecent as the shy and a little uptight Hailey Jennison gets, actually. She and her friends get together every Friday night for some very specific girl time. Gathering around the window in her friend's apartment, lights off, snacks and drinks in hand, they look out the window and down into the apartment of the man they refer to as Mr. Tool.The man is smoking hot and has a habit of walking around his apartment barely clothed, sometimes not clothed at all (and aren't those happy nights!), with his lights on and his shades up. Hey, a girl's gotta grab whatever salacious fun she can, right? It's harmless and he's the man of her dreams - literally. Then she goes out to get some more booze for the girl's night and Mr. Tool confronts her about her and her friends' weekly activities.Mr. Tool...Gage for those who actually know him as more than just a bit of man candy, gives Hailey an ultimatum. Either she goes out on a date with him, or he calls the cops and files a complaint about her and her friends' weekly peeping.For six months Gage has been hoping for a chance with Hailey. She had moved out of the complex before he worked up the courage to talk to her, but he caught her and her friends spying on him one night and has gone out of his way to make sure she has plenty to see ever since. True, blackmailing the woman for a date isn't exactly the most gallant thing he's ever done, but it got the job done. Finally. Now, if he can just manage to get through the date without opening his mouth and sticking one or both feet into it.To say Gage is socially awkward around women would be a gross understatement. It makes starting a relationship hard, especially when he is as attracted to a woman as he is Hailey. A little blackmail seems a small matter for his pride, though, if it gets him a shot with Hailey.~*~This deliciously erotic little bit of yumminess was fun for a hot, quick read. The plot was a bit light, and I'm not sure I bought the whole gorgeous-guy-has-to-blackmail-a-girl-for-a-date concept, but the characters were likable and the sex was abundant and hot. Sometimes, that's all I need to be happy with an erotic novella like this.I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters. Depth that I enjoyed. I was amused by the relationship between Gage and his brothers and mother. Those weekly breakfast/guilt sessions and the sibling ribbings that went on seemed very natural to the characters and situations. I enjoyed them a lot.I wish that Harte had pushed the envelope of Gage's awkwardness around women even further, because he never really struck me that way when he was around Hailey. He certainly wasn't Mr. Charming, but to have built up the level of neurosis he had over his lack of ability to speak to women without saying something wrong, I would have expected him to be much, much worse than he was. Maybe if he'd been even more blunt, or less endearing with his clumsiness, I would have bought into it a bit more.Hailey didn't do much for me, really. She didn't annoy, but she's too familiar as the uptight, tightly wound Type A personality bordering on prissy. The girl with a killer bod and an ice maiden exterior fashioned from her fear of pain. I wish more originality had gone into her character, but she at least held her own.I'm not a fan of the quick-to-love theme in romance, even in erotic novellas. That, for me, was the bigger issue with the story. I wish the romance had been given a longer lead time, even if it had been in condensed form. I also would have liked a meatier plot, and I'm no fan of relationship conflict that's nothing more than a failure to communicate, as it was here. Those are the things that held me back from completely liking what I read.It was hot, though, I'll say that. And I do have a soft spot for the themes of unrequited love (or lust) and love (lust) from afar, like Gage had for Hailey. He was kind of geeky-cute with his affections and I enjoyed that aspect very much. For a quick read that will definitely raise a gal's body temp, I'd recommend this one, but I personally would have liked more story and a less annoying conflict.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",Sexy Little Bite of Yum

840,"Unfortunately, I judge books by the cover at times. I wasn't too excited about this book based on the cover art. It just didn't seem to do anything for me but I decided to read it anyway.I am glad I ignored how I felt about the cover and read it. I enjoyed the fact that the main character was female. It seems so many of the ones I read are male.I am not too keen on mysteries but enjoyed this mystery. The reason I rate this novel four stars is because at times it is predictable.  I like how the author led all things together.I cannot decide however if I will purchase another novel by this author.",A good read

842,"Was a fun book to read.  I liked reading about the fog, the dangers and all the survival techniques the characters used.  I actually learned something.  Strange part was that the  purpose of the camp was to encourage teens to abstain from sex  .Many times during this book references of sexual relationships pop up which probably aren't needed to catch my attention.  I was already interested in the story without the sexual parts.Overall a fun book to read",Strange theory for a camp
843,"This doesn't appear to be a scan; if it is, it's a good one, better than the blurb suggests.  The main real fault I found was the poor Spafford child's name, variously given as Rose, Eose, Bose, Hose... though there were other slight, similar errors, but not as consistent.This is a sweet, old-fashioned, rather typical GLH story, with the unfortunate heroine, the honourable hero, the nasty villian, but perhaps more than usual 'gray area' characters, not so much evil as misguided.  There is some reference to the movement to abolish slavery; it might have been good if that were more developed, but it was an interesting sideline anyway.If you like GLH books, you'll like this one too.",A decent sequel to Marcia Schuyler
844,"RATING = 3.5 STARSIn From Afar we see two very different kinds of vampires.  There is Raphael who has chosen to live apart from the local vampire clan and their indulgent, violent lifestyle. Because of his choice, he is forced to live a lonely life apart from both human and vampiric society. The clan vampires, all male, live together under the rule of a single female vampire, Katerina.  All but two of the vampires in the clan have been turned by Katerina and therefore they belong to her.  Since Raphael was not turned by the female vampire he has no loyalties to her and although it may be dangerous for him, he chooses loneliness over the clan.When Raphael rescues Aleric from a vicious late night attack in an alley he is torn. Should he allow the man he's loved from afar for years to die as a result of his injuries, or risk his own life by challenging Katerina's authority in turning Aleric into a vampire and dooming him to a life he himself has long suffered?I really felt for Raphael.  His loneliness came through so clearly and when presented with a chance at possible happiness, he was torn between his need for the man he loved and the fear of losing him forever either in death or the chance that Aleric would hate him for turning him into a Vampire.  He was forced to make a choice that would change everything, not knowing if that would be for worse or better.I admit I was distrustful of Aleric early on in his relationship with Raphael. Before being turned, Aleric had not yet fully come to terms with his attraction to men. I worried that he was drawn to Raphael more because of the vulnerability he felt in his new vampire nature and was concerned he would eventually hurt or betray Raphael once he became more at ease with his new life as a vampire. Wondering if he would proclaim his love for Raphael or leave him in favor of clan life kept me on the edge of my seat.My only problem with From Afar was the unexpected ending.  I was engrossed in the story and looking forward to reading about how Aleric and Raphael would overcome their problems with Katerina and the clan vampires and was a little surprised when the story came to an end.Ava March is an author that I will most certainly want to read more from.  Her writing style easily drew me into this paranormal Regency Era romance  from the very beginning. The romantic relationship in From Afar was convincing, tugged at my heart strings, and left me wanting more.",From Afar by Ava March
845,"If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times: I am crazy about firefighters! A firefighter who saves me? Oh Mommy, he could get the firstborn kid. *smirk* I am suitably crazy over Lynn Lorenz's stories so I knew in advance that I would love this one. The fact that it describes my idea of the perfect vacation didn't hurt, either.Troy is doing the typical &#34;I can make him love me if we just spend enough time together&#34; single guy dance. In my book, if you have to &#34;make&#34; someone love you then it isn't real. He's been lusting after this idiot, Douglas, for a year. Troy has gone to great lengths to try to make himself attractive to this jerk, even though Troy's best friend describes Troy as smart, witty, and a gorgeous guy with a heart of gold. But, now Troy has his chance. He's spending a week on a cruise with Douglas and other friends and Troy just knows that when the seven days are up, Douglas will be his. When Troy's apartment goes up in flames due to his neighbor smoking while sleeping, Troy is forced out the bathroom window to balance precariously three stories up on a tiny ledge. Yikes!Lucky for Troy, Jason is the gorgeous firefighter who saves him and brings him down on the ladder. Troy realizes at the hospital that he has no one to call to come pick him up. He has no cell phone, no wallet, no money, no home. Troy is shocked when Jason appears at the hospital to check on him and even more surprised when Jason offers to let Troy stay with him until he can get things sorted out. Jason is a little surprised that he made the offer, too, but something about Troy rouses protective and possessive feelings that Jason has never had. It doesn't take these two gorgeous men long before they've fallen into bed and Jason is introducing Troy to a little bondage play. These guys are very intense and the sex is incredible. Jason is determined to give Troy a vacation he won't ever forget, and in the process hopes that Troy won't want to leave when his friends come back.The vacation starts with Jason getting Troy into much better-looking clothes than Dockers and button-downs. Troy is only five years older so why dress like an old man? Next it's up to the lake for a day of Jet Skis and parasailing, stuff Troy's never done before, and they have a blast. Jason takes Troy deep-sea fishing and it's some of the most fun Troy has ever had. Jason doesn't want to bring up looking for a new apartment and Troy doesn't either, but both believe the other wants them to, and so begin the miscommunications. Neither one of them wants to speak up about their feelings for fear if being hurt. Silly men. HA!If you enjoy a lighthearted romance with not a lot of drama but an incredible amount of sex, then this might be the story for you. It's fun, sweet, and sexy with a good ending.

846,"This is sci-fi non-consensual pet play/age play - heavier on the age play than the pet play.  I'm OK with non-con capture fantasies, so that was't the big problem for me.  It was Bach actually having an internal moment where was uncomfortable with having sex with what he thought of essentially an animal - and then goes ahead and does it without reservation later.  The author does try to mitigate that later, but it takes a long time until he actually views Pani as a person that he treats as a pet, not an actual pet.I don't have an issue with spanking books, so much as when the spanking goes from &#34;correction&#34; (as it is euphemistically labeled in so many books) to abuse - serious over the top beating for really no reason at all - which this book does.  I also struggle in general with age play - why would an adult think having sex with a child is a good thing?  This book never really explored why treating somebody like a toddler would turn them on any way that could possibly be deemed socially acceptable.I gave it 3 stars because the writing was very good - the world building was good, the characters were well developed.  I went on to read Pani's story because I was hoping that it would help me understand why the age play was erotic - and it did help.","Well written, but I just couldn't get comfortable with Bach"

850,"There are many things to like about Woodstock Forty Years Later. The author raises interesting questions about roads not taken, midlife crises, fidelity, forgiveness, and second chances. Unfortunately, he leaves too many questions unanswered, including two of the main plot points in the novel.Another shortcoming involved the author's research on the actual 40th Anniversary concert at Bethel in the Woods. He portrays it as a three day event with only a small sampling of the original bands. The event was actually a one day, six hour show that featured only acts that performed at the original show.A rewrite of the last 50 pages (and removal of the Epilogue)could easily bring this novel up to a 4.5 star rating in my book.

853,"~* 1.5 Stars *~Yoga instructor and business owner Kerri Harris and divorce attorney Mitch MacAuley have been best friends for years. Only friends. But when Kerri and Mitch are out one night sharing a friendly drink, she tells him she wants to marry and asks Mitch to introduce her to some single, eligible men. There's nothing Mitch wouldn't do for Kerri, but her request bothers him. A lot.As she starts to date the guys he reluctantly introduces her to, he gets more and more uncomfortable and tension rises in their friendship. Soon the friendly quips between them that used to be teasing fun take on more bite and a decade long friendship goes from smooth to rocky. Tensions and tempers rise between them. Pushed to the brink, a fight between them ends in a kiss - a wild, tempestuous kiss that changes everything...but solves nothing. Can two friends accept the fact that they're made for each other or will the differences between them kill their friendship and destroy the chance for love?Despite the fact that the friends-turned-lovers theme is one of my favorites in contemporary romance, I had way too many problems with this book to be charmed. The plot was two dimensional and predictable, the narrative lacked sophistication, the dialogue lacked conversational flow, and the characters lacked charm.The characters were the biggest problem. More specifically, Kerri. Mitch had little to recommend him as a romantic lead, but he wasn't overly objectionable, despite an unhealthy anger management issue or two. Kerri, on the other hand, I found to be utterly contemptible. She blames Mitch for everything that goes wrong in their relationship, takes no responsibility for her own actions or feelings on any matter, flits between wildly contradictory emotions at a blink, is pathologically immature, and is grievously self involved. I may not have warmed up to Mitch, but I actively disliked Kerri.The romance started to improve towards the end, but ended up floundering when the dialogue took a turn for the worse. Two comments in particular stick in my mind, at the turning point for the relationship between Mitch and Kerri, Mitch says the following:""I want to be with you, and most of all, I don't want anyone else to be with you.You think you need a husband? Fine, then - it's going to be me.""You want kids and I want them to be mine. Nobody else's.""Neither one of those comments come anywhere near my idea of romance, nor do they inspire a lot of confidence in the relationship. Mitch comes off seeming less interested in being with Kerri because he loves her and more interested in making sure that she's not with anyone else. Admittedly, these comments are taken out of context, but they provide examples of the problems I had with the dialogue.On the positive side, Jamieson writes very sensual, erotic sex scenes. The naked yoga in particular was a sultry, seductive delight, and as a whole the sex was very well done and provided the best written scenes in the book. The rest, unfortunately, didn't work for me.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",Little Benefit Here

858,"This contemporary romance set in London turned into a terminology mystery for this 'Yank' as I had great difficulty with the medical titles for the hospital personnel and departments.I found it very distracting trying to imagine what medical duty the individual character was performing in the hospital (registrar, porter, consultant, etc.) and after a while I didn't care anymore.  How hard would it have been for the author to put an a few lines of English/American Medical glossary in the back explaining the difference between a Doctor versus a Mister?  Apparently both are medical professionals of some distinction in a London hospital, but I couldn't make heads or tails out of it.  The story was based in a hospital and I couldn't separate the story from the setting, so I was constantly being distracted by uncommon terms.With regard to the love story, I felt the ten year span was too long for the separation, but I understand it was needed for them to establish their careers.  Too many things happen in 10 years - people settle for things and move on - I felt this was too pat of a story.

867,"I stumbled across `Seducing a Stranger' while looking for another book with a similar title,Strangers Just This Night: Sweet Erotic Romanceby Sandra Ross.  It looked like a good book, so I downloaded it and gave it a quick read, and am very glad I did!`Seducing a Stranger' is a historical erotic story that really puts you in the world inhabited by the characters.  Victoria Paget is a widow seeking proof that her husband, a Captain, was murdered.  She resorts to going to a bawdy house to seduce the Lieutenant that she suspects is responsible for her dear husband's death.  She feels that she has to do this so she won't let him down in death the way she feels she did during his life.  She is a strong, vivid character that is easy to relate to and impossible not to like.Tom Godfrey is the sexy young Lieutenant that is believed by Victoria to be behind her husband's death.  He turns out to be gentlemanly and is extremely surprised to find the widow of his previous Captain in the bawdy house, and he falls instantly in love with her.  Of course, this being an erotic story, I should probably say he fell in lust with her, lol!  The two quickly become involved in a hot, steamy relationship that is put to the test when Victoria finally discloses her beliefs about Tom.I liked the historical aspect of the story, and the author did a good job keeping the language and description appropriate for a historical story.  Although it is hard to develop characters that are believable and likeable in a short story, the author did a commendable job.  I especially like Victoria and the fact that she was willing to go to such extreme measures to get her dead husband the respect she felt he deserved.  I am not sure I could put myself in such a dire situation as selling my body just for answers, and the time period in which the story takes place would have made that an extremely risky endeavor for a widow to undertake.Tom was also a great character; although a true gentleman wouldn't be in a bawdy house in the first place, so that put me off him a little bit.  However, the sexy bits were sizzling and fit the story perfectly.  The descriptions used were exciting and appropriate, and they made the story really stand out.  I would say that if I found other works by this author I would probably read them since I enjoyed this one so much.  I would definitely recommend this book to others, and even though it was not the book I was looking for, it was just right for the mood I was in!",Hot historical story!

I am sick of writers making it look like a man only sleeps with women for a need to be fulfilled. That is not true. Yes, they can keep out the emotional attachments but they still get excited over the woman they are with (they kind of have to). I hate thinking that another woman can so easily take the place of the heroines in these stories. Who cares that there is not emotion in the hero's couplings, he still thinks about how many women he went through and how they dressed sexily when the heroine was wearing comfortable clothes, and let us not forget the thought of how his past women were willing to do explicit things to him!! That was gross and unneeded for the story! I actually started out liking him in the first chapter before it skipped ahead 8 years and to a completely different guy and a douchebag to boot! He also manipulated the heck out of a situation to get his way, harming the heroine and potentially harming the child if the press would have gotten worse. He did not think about anything but himself and his wants. He was NO HERO!!!!",Hmmm...

The author tells you that Nissa is drawn to the club and to Hex & Aleron.  The reader is then told after days of having sex in every way possible in a menage that love now exists.  At that point - all I could do was think - well, that's nice - didn't ever feel the love but whatever.I like stories with a high ""heat"" factor but I also want well-developed plots with interesting characters and interactions.In this novella:- Dialogue was flat- Characters one dimensional- No originality- The plot is ????? - not sure if there is one- Sex scenes read more like a ""how to"" book than an erotic scene- Rushed HEA - they had sex and then the reader is told that they are in love - didn't really feel itThe short story was mostly pages after pages of the three having sex but I would describe it as just graphic rather than erotic and definitely not sizzling.  If you want a very short ""how to"" book on a few of the different ways to have sex - then this book is for you.  Not very imaginative but it does contain some of the standard ways found in countless of erotica books that are more original and better developed.",Flat and Under-developed
885,"I have had this book for many months and I have attempted to read it several times. The problem I have is that the storyline is excellent, but the writing drags tremendously, in my opinion. I know that some people appreciate this ""full disclosure"" type of writing. I'm just not one of those people. I don't think it's necessary to know the look of the scene at every moment, or the clothes the characters are wearing, or other things that really don't pertain to the story, especially in a story that is supposed to be fast-paced. I understand bringing the characters and scenery to life, but I feel this book goes too far, and it loses me every time I try to read it. I can't recommend this book unless the person who is going to read it appreciates too much explanation (I say 'too much', but I agree that for some, it's not too much - this is strictly my opinion). To reiterate - the storyline is quite interesting and has kept me attempting to read it on several occasions. I just haven't been able to jump the ""too much detail"" hurdle. Maybe some day.",Difficult
886,The story was okay but I would expect more from this and it should have an epilogue since it was only eight chapters.  The writer may be cracking out to manny books and doing some cut and pasting mmmm.,Okay Read

888,"This was a very emotional, and touching story. Lilly in her first marriage, had a miscarriage, a stillborn. Her last pregnancy she had her son, which was born with birth defects. He didn't live long. Her husband couldn't stand to look or hold his own son. It tore Lilly's heart apart. She loved her son with her heart and soul. After the funeral, she received divorce papers. She now works for an adult daycare.  She loves her job, and knows she is helping other families. Lilly and jack were dating, but Jack broke it off. The two still cared for each other. When they found out Lilly was pregnant, Jack stepped up to the plate. Lilly was scared, and Jack gave her his strength, and comfort. This is a book I think all should read. It was really moving.Sample from chapter 7 - His goal was to take the necessary steps to help his daughters adjust to a blended family and to make sure Lilly's decision to marry him was well thought out and deliberate. That it was a decision she'd never regret. And if he had to woo her one dinner date, one yoga class, one shopping spree at a time, he'd do it gladly.Sample from chapter 8 - ""The baby could have so many things wrong, it would never be able to leave home and might need machines to stay alive."" ""That sucks."" Yes, it did. ""I have to go, sweetie."" Lilly patted Miranda's shoulder. ""Please don't tell anyone about the baby until I say you can. Okay?"" ""My mother doesn't tell people about me, either."" ""I can't believe that,"" Lilly said vehemently, although admittedly, she didn't know Miranda's mother. Her sister always brought her to the center. ""Sometimes, when she thinks I'm not around, she says she only has one daughter."" ""Oh, Miranda."" Lilly could have cried. The young woman crewed up her face into an angry scowl. ""I bet if you had a kid like me, you'd be the same way."" Lilly pulled Miranda into a fierce hug. ""If I had a daughter like you, I'd be so happy and s proud, I'd tell everybody I met about my beautiful girl, and how much I loved her.""",Very emotional story

890,"""Second Chance Romance"" was a quick and easy read.  A man and a woman, who were in love in high school, but then went their separate ways.  They make contact 10 or so years later, and decide to see what happens as they begin to renew their teenage relationship - as grown-ups.  He's a goalie for a Canadian hockey team with some uncertaintly about his contract being renewed.  She's a divorced mother, an elementary school teacher, with a young child, and living in Canada, but a bit of a distance away.  They test the waters and give renewing their relationship, with all the complications of their lives now, a shot.  This is a long distance relationship - mostly mother and son spending time with him, mostly weekends. in his house, in his city.This is a sweet read, without much substance, that touches upon, but glosses over and doesn't really deal with or resolve the complications in their current lives and how that will work, as they attempt to give their old love a second shot.There are a few serious issues (brought up, but not fully addressed).  She's a single, working mother with an 8 year old son by her ex-husband who's not in the picture.  He's a good hockey player, but his future with his current team isn't secure.  And there's her sweet, smart and funny son - a young boy with his needs to consider.It's pretty much ""stock romance"", touching on some important issues, but not resolving them.","An easy read - a sweet, pleasant, parfait confection of a romance"

892,"I had high hopes for this book.  The cover is stunning, the title beautiful and I have a weak spot for WWII-based stories.I started reading the book and getting to know Rebecca and Eli.  Perhaps it's because I'm taking an English Comp class, and this weeks subject is Observation, but I noticed that every little thing had something describing it.  Rebecca sitting down on a ""white"" couch, every article of clothing described by color, every outfit change detailed.  It was so stilted in the description that I couldn't enjoy the pictures being created and felt uncomfortable by reading them.But the real breaking point for me was when Rebecca and Eli have a picnic on Valentine's Day... and then go swimming in a nearby lake.  Now, granted, I've never been to Germany, but I do have friends who live in Germany and there is not a single one of them who would be caught dead going swimming in a lake in February.  I think the author may have lost track of the time in the book because she also described the sky as being the ""spring"" sky, and February is not generally called spring, here or there.I'm chalking this book up to being another sappy, sad, average WWII story with some bad editing.  Disappointing, I wanted to love this one.",Review of The Day the Flowers Died
893,"This book pulled at my heart strings as I connect with the afterlife in my personal life. The stories were heartfelt, and one thing I liked about them is they were not all sugar coated. Sometimes the messages from beyond the grave are not always what we want to hear, or think our loved ones will tell us. I find that spirits I didn't know when they were alive are even more candid about their former lives and death.  Good book!",Happily Ever After
894,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 7/10PROS:- This author excels at historical works. The settings are rich and detailed, and the language is elegant and (at least to my eyes) contains few or no historical inaccuracies.- I loved the play back and forth between the two men: the fight for dominance as well as the easing of tension when they&#8217;re alone, especially considering how properly they both behave in public.CONS:- There are scenes from both characters&#8217; perspectives in the story, but I wanted to see a bit *more* from Arsen&#8217;s point of view. I was more interested in seeing inside of the arrogant wastrel&#8217;s head than the lovesick puppy&#8217;s.- We don&#8217;t get to see any of the men&#8217;s past interactions; we&#8217;re simply told about them briefly. As a result, the love Arsen feels for Henry wasn&#8217;t very believable for me.Overall comments: I enjoyed this, but the deficiencies in character development prevented me from loving it. It&#8217;s a pretty short story (1170 Kindle locations), and it&#8217;s at least 50% sex. The romantic element of it felt a bit lopsided to me in that one man is obviously crazy in love and the other has a tinge of indifference about him.",Romance felt a bit lopsided to me
895,"Alicia, and Adam spent one incredible night together. Neither of them had ever experience sparks that intense with another living soul. It was like magic. The next morning Alicia, slipped out of Adam's house and walked away. During the next four months she often wondered about him. She didn't even have his last name. She was called into her boss's office. She didn't even know her boss, or shall I say she didn't think she did. She was speechless when she found out her boss was Adam. She was even more shocked when he accused her of stealing from the company. Alicia had two choices, Jail time, or to be Adam's mistress... She became Adam's mistress, hoping that would give her time to prove her innocents. This was a good books. I can't put my finger on it, but something was missing from the plot... The sparks between Adam, and Alicia was there. it did turn out to be a sweet romance.",good book
896,"I thought this book started out fairly well.About half way through there came one plot element/device that pretty much occupied the rest of the story.That's okay, but not great.  It left me with the feeling that not too much happened.The world seemed a bit thin and there were few compelling allusions to anything greater and deeper churning within the as-yet-untold-story behind the story.I waffled a bit between a 3 & a 4 rating, but I did enjoy the read, so I opted for the 4.As other commenters mentioned, there's a lot of hiccups to the writing due to incorrect grammar and occasionally the narrative will shift very temporarily to first person and jolt the reader out of the story.There's also that horrible horrible war between 'effect' and 'affect' that is rampant within this book.  These words are commonly misused within the book, which obviously irritated other reviewers more than it did me, yet I was not completely immune.What bothered me more was the lack of characterization and rationale for the actions of certain characters.  Some characters seemed stupid-angry simply because it was the only way to advance the plot in the direction the author wanted.Obviously I liked the book in certain ways.  I liked the main character.  I liked the process in which he began making a place for himself in his world.  I liked the relationships he had with several of his peers (and I liked several of those peers).  I liked the general description of the world.  I even liked the beginning of the main conflict, and a bit of the middle of the main conflict (though it seemed to drag on at some points).The question is how much promise does this author and this series have?  Will I pay $2.99 for the second book in the series?Right now I'm leaning against it.But if my current stash of $0.99 fiction runs dry, it will be in the realm of possibility.",Not as much to go on as I hoped...
897,"The first three books were 5 stars!! It is hard to believe the same person wrote this book. It does not follow the devolpment of the characters, it goes off in a different direction then you would have expected from the first three books. very disappointed.",not true to first three books

899,"Every romance has its formula.  In regency tales, the hero is generally a second son, whose older brother heir is killed off, leaving him reluctantly or earnestly in charge of the family fotunes, and scrambling for a bride to secure the succession.  In more modern tales, the male is some alpha leader evrty female looks up to, muscular, hot, ever the consumate lover, caring, etc. etc.  In this story no one is killed off (unless you count baby Lily, or the near death of her mother early in the book), and the hero and heroine have carried a torch for each other for years.  What I found most off-puttying was their willingness to let that love slide for ten years.  More frustrating still was their extreme reluctance to re-unite when the opportuniy presented itself.  What good is an alpha male too chicken to risk his heart?  And just how self-sacrificing does the heroine have to be, becuase she's fertility challenged?  But just when you want to knock their heads together they come around right.I must admit, though, this seemed a lot longer than 124 pages! Be that a good or a bad thing, I leave to you to determine.","Predictable, yes, but sometimes you just need an HEA"
900,"Bought this book a while ago, stayed up all night to read it. It drew me in immediately. I connected to the characters. It was steamy and passionate while still being a really well-fleshed out story. It's a collection of 3 related erotic historic romance novellas. The first two stories are my favorite, since I've gotten the book I've reread them many times, the emotions are just so powerful. The third one is good but seems to be tied up too quickly. Anyway I love this book and I heartily recommend it.",I loved it

902,"I finally got through this book. It is well written, but just not my thing. I remember Woodstock though I was slightly above the age to wallow in the mud with the attendees! However, this book seems to be always searching for something--the main character didn't connect with his teen girlfriend, he fails to make a complete connection with his wife which would last into the senior years, and he fails to make a connection with his teen girlfriend when they connect 40 years later. There just seems to be something missing from the whole book. Main character never seems to reach whatever it is he is striving for. The book left me wanting something more to wrap up all the dangling ends.",Apparently not my thing!
903,"Just finished a heavy trilogy so I just wanted a shorter sexy read. Private Property seemed like a great fit and since I had it on my Kindle already, I'd say it was perfect timing to give it a go.I loved the beginning where Jodi was doing her surveillance work. I also liked when she was acting all ninja like by breaking into the house. She gets caught and as it turns out, the sexy wish list she made was about was just about to be granted by her boss & boyfriend.I have to say that the menage scenes were mediocre to me because I didn't really like the third that was brought in. He seemed very beefy and the way he acted so protective of Jodi was just weird. He just met her. It was odd that he was ""if you ever hurt I'll hurt you"" attitude. It was overly brotherly or fatherly and very odd since he only met her that night.It was a quick read so there was not a whole lot of time for character development but I would recommend for a short sexy read. Seeing as I got it for free, it was a great deal.",Its okay

906,"Normally I'm not picky about editing or grammar in a book. However, this book has so many editing errors in just the first chapter alone. It was very distracting when I was trying to read the story. Half the sentences don't have periods at the end; or commas to make the sentence make more sense. And the different people talking is in quotes right next to each other in the same paragraph.  So you have to re-read the paragraph to figure out who said what.That being said, I did enjoy the story. If an updated version is released that fixes the editing problems I would probably read it again.","Good story, but needs editing."

910,"The first Hell Cop was incredibly enjoyable and something just that little bit different. In this 2nd book they're building on already established relationships and reading it was like visiting with old friends. God. I am such a sap. But it was just so good!Trust Me, by Astrid Amara, has Jay and Brian a year down the track. Jay still delights in being able to touch someone and Brian is growing into his own skin after the revelations' in the previous book. The growth of the characters relationship was beautifully done and the hook of Brian's lack of control was an engaging one. He begins to realize that his ability to touch Jay does not exclude him from being left and his need to learn to control his power, or risk loosing his lover, becomes paramount. A sexy, perceptively written story that does not just look at the surface of a relationship, but delves deeply into its workings.In Dark Waters, by Nicole Kimberling, the world building is tight and I like her attention to little things that make for vivid reading. The balance of power in a relationship, knowing when to listen and when to argue, brought a warmness to the story. Michael is such a professor and I like how out of his comfort zone he is with Argent at times, when he cannot use his mind reading powers. Parts were also surprisingly funny and had me laughing out loud. I think Bert's - a bunch of drunken goat-legged midgets and that poor, maligned turtle were rather amusing. hehe.Finally, in Such Heights by Ginn Hale, dark and broody Moran returns on another case with his blond and gorgeous journalist lover  James. Moran is still determined to resist till the last and I think there is nothing more satisfying than reading about this cop being brought to his knees. So to speak. O-o The floating palace was a very cool world with tentacle like spells and enslaved demons, which made for a cool backdrop for the characters.Freeloading, hippie mermaids, large bovine like creatures, pocket demons and castles that travel about in the air.

911,"Lissa decided to ignore her queer feelings about getting on the hotel shuttle.  She needed to find another position, and it was the only way to make it to the job conference.  What follows next is a near death experience that changes her life forever when a gorgeous vineyard owner rescues her.Atticus Maxwell is a vampire enforcer who's lived for centuries, yearning and hoping for the One to bring meaning to his life.  Meeting Lissa knocks him out of his ennui once he's awakened to an all encompassing love.  Could she be the One he's searched for?  Once it's learned that the accident was no accident, Atticus does everything in his power to ensure that Lissa stays alive long enough for them to explore all the possibilities.Most of the vampire novels I tend to steer towards are usually dark, violent, brutal and brimming with lurid sex (think JR Ward), which makes them not quite as emotionally romantic as One and Only.  This delightfully sweet paranormal romance carried an ""R in Romantic"" timeless vibe.  Sure the sex is sensual, at times even naughty, but the amiable warmth here is old school.  It's not in the bodice ripper class; there's definitely violin and piano music serenading reader heartstrings.Atticus is noble and honorable with that air of Byronic tragedy that makes him vulnerable without being a stuffy wimp.  When he opens his heart and life to the equally lonely and engaging Lissa, I was so glad they finally found one another.  There's a tender thread throughout that works well with themes of friendship, loyalty, and hope, as well as the continuing battle of good vs. evil.  All in all, I was left with a pleasant feeling, which means I'd like to see where this series goes.  Bianca D'Arc does well setting everything up for the next series installment, and I'm positive that she'll more than deliver on it.  If that doesn't convince you, take a look at the mesmerizing delectable cover.Patrice F.Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",One and Only

Their sadness over the loss of a pregnancy and the subsequent break-up of the marriage come back to the fore as they both try to deal with past issues and newly reawakened feelings.The first half of the book is the most exiting and is really good. Unfortunately, the second tends to drag on, with nothing new being introduced. I got tired of hearing about the baby that was lost, her medical problems and how it affected their lives.Their reasoning for having sex, after ten long years, was just laughable. The fact that he recognized his ex-wife from her feet is unbelievable.I agree with the reviewer who noted that there is a lot of medical content. It is very distracting and does not add to the plot. Who cares if he is Doctor or Mister ? If they need more consultants or that Lorna (the wife) is too slow in writing her notes on her patients ? Color and context are nice but this was too much and, for a none practician, almost dizzying.It's a nice romantic story if you can get to the end.","Good beginning, drags on a bit too much"

927,"First of all, let me preface my review by letting you know up front that I don't consider A MATTER OF NECESSITY to be a romance.  It is a fictional FBI crime novel that just happens to feature two men in love.  The crime solving is the central plot, and the romance happens offstage.  Even the sex happens offstage.  In fact, at times it felt like everything in this book happened offstage.  Throughout the entire book I felt like I was reading a summary of a story, not the actual story itself.My problems with this book come from the fact that I never felt as though I was invited inside the story.  It was a very odd feeling.  The author's offstage style is such that I felt like I was reading the Cliffs Notes or watching bits and pieces of the story through a closed window, which was a real shame.  I absolutely adored the characters and I wish I had been allowed to experience their romance and their blossoming relationship first-hand rather than from behind closed doors.  Alex was surprisingly accepting of his love for his best friend and the social consequences that came with admitting he was gay.  Shawn was determined to show Alex how much he loved him and was willing to do anything for Alex's love.  How sweet is that?This is an entertaining book and very worthy of three stars, but I could have easily given it five stars if I'd been invited into the story and allowed to witness the tender romance between Alex and Shawn firsthand.  I recommend this book to fans of M/M cop drama, but romance fans may feel short-changed.",A MATTER OF NECESSITY by T. D. McKinney
928,"I started off with high hopes for this story because I really love paranormal romance especially with werewolves, but this book was basically one hard-core sex scene after another with a plot added on. I don't have any objection to the sex scenes themselves (though I did find the language unnecessarily coarse), but I wanted them to be needed in order to move the story along and not just be there. I also did not believe that the queen could have so much hatred and fear for werewolves and still fall madly in love so quickly just because of Mace's sexual prowness and dominance. I also couldn't see how Nayla had no problems sexually after being raped by her parents' murderer who was a werewolf. Overall, I thought that the story line was good but I didn't really enjoy reading the book and I would hesitate to recommend it to others.",Not as good as I'd hoped
929,I had just gotten a Kindle sample and then ordered the whole set of books.  I really enjoyed reading them all.,Thoroughly enjoyed
930,"I love Bella Andre and cannot wait for more of the Sullivan's...she promised that this summer she would continue with the series....I have read them all twice and will read them all again....The Sullivan men are so handsome and such regal gentlemen....a woman loves to believe that there is really a man out there that is just like them...Rich and yet honorable and so sexy and so understanding...they actually can feel what they're loved one is going through and doesn't make her wrong and always strives to make it right and wonderul...of course the &#34;sex&#34; scenes are amazing and yet so believable....Ms. Andre, I am waiting for more of your wonderful and talented imagination to be put in print...",The Queen of Love and Lust.
931,This was a truly enjoyable read. Both main characters were so different but likable in their own way. The love scenes were sexy and hot and definitely added some heat to my imagination. Good action great romance!,Definitely worth reading!
932,"The story was great. I am a big fan of horror/mystery/suspense. This had everything, white knuckle moments, breath holding suspense, a little gore to make you a little sick. My only problem was that it was way too short. I was so intrigued by the story that I wanted it to go on for at least a few more chapters. The story line was there, so did the author run out of ideas? The author needs to read a little Stephen King to learn how to extend a story. What a great creepy one this could have been.",Needed more story
933,"so cheesy I'm thinking  I don't even want to continue with the rest of the series..... It seems like she's trying to make it different, but nah, sorry!! :(",eh..not so much
934,"I wasn't going to buy this book based on the review about a white man buying a black women. Then curiosity got the best of me and I had to see if someone really wrote a book about erotic romance trying to sex up slavery. BUT that is not what happens here and I'm glad I bought it and read it for myself. Yes an arrangement was made between two CONSENTING adults. And in this arrangement he flat out told her he wanted to have sex with her in exchange she got what she wanted. He gave her WEEKS to back out and thought she would, she didn't. Also, even up until the point where he was touching her he told she could back out. There was no holding down and raping. She was suprised(and ashamed) herself she WANTED to have sex with him. And even after the first time he continued to tell her she could back out of the deal. Was he a little crude(he was crude when he made the offer,she shouldn't have been shocked) yes, stern, yes. He didn't have to allow her time to get herself together to have sex. The deal was, will you sleep with me (not in those nice words), and do as I wish when I wish it? Her answer, yes, in exchange you will do x,y,z for me, which he did. What's there to wait for? He didn't say, ""will you stay with me, be my companion, we will get to know each other, THEN if sex happens it happens"". She knew what was up, SHE sold herself to get what she wanted...and it was never to late to back out.","Better than I thought, no slave swap here!"

939,"Spring, 1876, ColoradoLaurel Daniels's trip home from visiting her grandmother goes very wrong when her train is held up by a notorious gang and one of them decides to take her as a bonus.  Fortunately, she's not a weepy, woe-is-me kind of girl.  It's obvious that she's scared and just when it seems that her situation can't be much worse, she becomes the focus of a disagreement amongst the gang.Cal Riker was horrified when he saw Norton pull the beautiful woman from the train.  He may be running with the gang of outlaws but he isn't truly one of them.  Rather than let them take turns raping her, Cal offers his share of the profits in exchange for her.  If there's any hope of his saving her from their lecherous intents then he'll have to make them believe he wants her all to himself.Laurel's shocked to learn that Cal is the legendary killer she's heard so much about but his actions aren't what she'd expect of a ruthless man.  It would have been simple for him to take advantage of her but instead he protects her and insists that he'll deliver her safely to her family.Laurel quickly realizes that she's extremely attracted to Cal and for the first time in her life she's willing to put her heart on the line. Cal tries to play a tough-as-nails outlaw but there's a softer side to him.  They spend a lot of time alone together after leaving the gang and neither of them regrets it when they become lovers.  Cal assumes that their time together will come to an end when she returns home.  Laurel has other ideas.  She's determined to make a life with him and with her family's influence she's sure that it's a possibility.  Is there any hope that he can escape his past and become the model citizen she's sure he can be?Emma Wildes tells awesome historical tales and this story is a prime example of why she's an author on my auto buy list.  LAWLESS is full of all the historical wonders, emotional angst and sexual tension I've come to appreciate in my reading material.  Laurel is a spunky character who's found herself in a difficult situation that would have reduced most women to tearful begging.  Cal is an honorable man who does what he believes is right - and it's cost him the sort of life that he should have lived.  This is a wonderful tale that leaves you with a smile in your heart which in my opinion is always the best sort of story.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",You just gotta love it when the outlaw turns out to be sooo good!
940,I thought the work was boring and a bit repetitive.  I also had no connection to the characters and got bored half way through.,Boring Story

943,This book was actually better than I though it would be.  The story had some substance and kept my attention throughout the book.,Better than I expected
944,"Was a little disappointed in this book.  To start it was way too short.  I was getting through it so quickly that I could not remember it was a sample or the actual book.  The author turned what could have been a great book and cut it down to an ""ok"" short story.  The end could have been jaw dropping if the author had taken us there properly.  In the end it was a good idea... but execution was lacking.",ok book... Not great

947,"Having been a devoted fan of Lovecraft all my life (he's my all-time favorite writer), I HAD to buy this book for the Kindle I just received today. It has almost all of his stories ... for only 1.99! That's less than 200 pennies! So far I only read From Beyond, one of my favorite stories of his. I found a few small typos, but that's okay. Editors are not perfect! Every book on the market has a least a couple of errors in them. I'm still giving this 5 stars. It's H.P. Lovecraft! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended if you're an H.P. fan!",Just bought it. Love it without having read it.
948,"This one is a really hard one to rate. I will say it now holds the record for the book that kept me up the latest ( three thirty in the morning for heaven's sake! I just couldn't put it down.) The suspense and mystery parts of the story were SO GOOD but the romance and overall moral of the story was SO frustrating!There were really only two problems (ok, the writing wasn't top notch in places but that can be over looked), the first is concerning the romance between Jack and Bella. Jack is a hired assassin who has been in love with Bella for 10 years, she is in love with him also but they have kept their relationship on the best friend level because of his profession. When things blow apart and they find themselves on the run and fighting for their (and their loved ones) lives, their relationship takes a major turn bringing all the feelings to the forefront. Jack has been holding out in a big way, however, and Bella starts to uncover all the lies and deceit he has been employing against her (in order to ""protect"" her). At least 5 or 6 times the topic is brought up with both the characters stating they will need to discuss and work these problems out between them. Jack must explain his reasons to Bella before she can ever trust him again. With all the action, however, these HUGE issues never get resolved, they have been the elephant in the room through half the stinking book and it NEVER HAPPENS! They just smile and walk off into the sunset together. AGH!!!!The other problem is probably personal. The killer for hire concept with the killer, who murders whoever he's hired to just for the big money, and with no remorse whatsoever, being the ""hero""- along with the contradictory plot where he is saving the son who's family have been assassinated by he and his associates just doesn't sit well. If there had been any redemption or remorse or change in attitude it would have worked for me. As it was, all good and bad just became a very dark gray. All were bad, the ones you root for are getting paid to kill indiscriminately, the ones you want to lose are also getting paid to kill indiscriminately, they're just trying to kill the ones we're rooting for. In the end, even the heroine goes to the dark side. Ick",A mixed bag
949,I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book.  The plot was unusual.  Don't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me.,Nice vintage story
950,"Again I have to write a less than stellar review and unfortunately, again, many of the issues would have been addressed and rectified in the EDITTING process. That said, here goes:- A period is required at the end of a sentence, even if the end of that sentence is dialogue and encased in quotation marks.- Very repetitive. He does, she doesn't. She does, he doesn't. What was probably supposed to be drama, when repeated over and over and over is not. The inability of the main characters to believe anything but the worst of each other leads the reader to conclude they are morons rather than successful adults.- Phrases joined together all over the place with commas and conjunctions when they should have been separate sentences.It's pretty basic: you can have the best story idea in the world, and you may even be able to write it, but if you don't get an EDITOR to tighten it up and correct the errors you can't or don't see, it ends up reading like a teenager of average intelligence wrote it for an English class.This review sounds snarkier than I intended, but I'm getting really tired of reading uneditted books (I think most of you have figured that out by now).",Cute premise that went on too long...
951,With each book and e-book Ms. Showalter writes her writing is constantly improving as well as her creativity.  I look more forward to her mini ebooks as well as her novels and this book is no different.  The Greek Goddess of Strenght Nike (heroine) and the Lord Titan (Atlas) are two well developed characters that develop an intense hate-love relationship. This relationship quickly reverses itself to a love-hate relationship when the tables are turned and Atlas imprisons Nike to get his hard sought revenge after being imprison by her for centuries.  However once revenge has been achieved it does not taste as sweet as he would have like.  Atlas seeks for ways to make Nike prison life more miserable yet with each way he tries to torture her he is further torture by his growing feelings of love.  This ebook is fanstastic and I thouroughly look forward to the next book of Gena Showalter.,Gena Showalter's ebooks rocks just as well as her novels

953,The length of the story is part of the problem. Characters and plot didn't have time to fully develop.

955,"The frustrating thing about the ""Scintillating Samples"" series is that some stories stand perfectly well on their own and others do not.  This is one of the ones that doesn't.Minnie (or Minerva) is the main character.  She has a ton of back story inelegantly crammed into a small space.  She was married to an abusive ""brownshirt"" (apparently it is 1936 in this story, but there is absolutely nothing to tip you off to that) who died.  Her daughter-in-law is a ""Druid"" and is reading her mind at all times.  The ""Druid"" thing makes little sense when you think the story is set in the present-day and zero sense when you realize the story is set in the 1930s.The plot is just pure silly wish fulfillment.  Minnie has low self-esteem and this random guy (her best friend's husband's best friend) just shows up, gives her a bunch of money for a quilt, and falls in love with her.  There is a brief hint of danger which is resolved super-easily.The male main is just too unrealistic, the reader is missing too much background information, and the character interactions are contrived.I do not recommend this story.",Confusing
956,As posted on The Smutty Kitty reviewed by KittyKelly4 out of 5 LicksMy first audio book review!!!  :)  Here's to many more! Now on to business... Gregory Salinas has a lovely voice.  I wouldn't mind him following me around an narrating what I'm doing.  That would be pretty awesome!  At times when he was reading as the men his voice became a bit mechanical but it either stopped or I got used to it because I didn't notice it as much toward the end.  Moving on to the writing-I am not sure how I haven't read this one from Jayne yet.  I've read most of her books and I have this on my signed shelves but I guess I missed reading it.  lol While I can tell that it is one of her earlier works she still has that same Jayne sparkle shining through.  Started off with some seriously HOT sex on the roof of a car and moved into a threesome.  It was a bit cheesy at times but that happens in most romance.  The steamy hot sex makes up for the cheesy times though cause it's seriously smoking hot.  There is also a bit of nerd factor going on with lots of technical aspects surrounding an invention they are trying to protect.  If you want to give audiobooks or Jayne a try this is a great way to start!,Nice And Naughty
957,"I bought this Cliff Black book and another one (Persons Missing or Dead) at the same time because they had such high star ratings, and read this one first.  I did not like the writing style of this story.  It is a very good mystery story line, but for me, it was very dry and boring to read, like eating a bowl of Grapenuts without any milk - not a pleasant experience.  Though the book is action packed, it just seemed very two-dimensional.As I said, I bought two Cliff Black books at the same time, and after I read this book, I wished I hadn't.  HOWEVER, I disliked how this book was written so much, that I immediately read the next Cliff Black book so I could get them both off my kindle, and I LOVED the next one I read (Person's Missing or Dead), and have immediately gone and bought the next Four Corners Mystery.  It's like a completely different author wrote the Four Corner Mysteries, or perhaps a more experienced author.  The Four Corners Mystery is set closer to modern times, they at least have cell phones, (but unfortunately it's dated due to use of zip drives) and the Perfect Crimes story is set back in the 80's if I recall rightly.  I think it would be a great story if Cliff re-wrote it using his current writing skills.Obviously I am odd-man-out on my opinion on this book, as I think it's up to 4.5 stars, but still, this is my take on it.",Needs a re-write

The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!

And while the characters were well fleshed out I found myself not really liking them.  There was not enough lightness in the dialogue between them to actually get into the romance.

984,"A very short story by two authors who wrote about two different persons with sadistic murder fantasies. Definitely not for those who have nervous disorders, heart ailments, gastric problems and those who are very sensitive, since this short story reveals how some people get wild pleasure and horrific thrill in killing a person slowly and painfully using some of the most deadly methods and instruments to kill.The basic underlying warning from the authors is about hitch-hiking (getting a free-drive  on the highways and expressways, from un-known persons).Two short stories, one with Donaldson (an elderly freelance courier man) and another Lucy (a young female guitarist). The first picks-up young boys and girls looking for a ride on the highway, ensures an isolated place and kills them most brutally after raping them. The murder is so horrendous that the victim is made to suffer the slow death by chopping off his/her vital organs one by one. Donaldson enjoys the screams and pain of the victim while doing so. Finally he burns the remains of the dead victim to keep the police clue-less. Similarly another young girl Lucy chooses cars on the highway for a lift/ride and uses a different strategy of injecting a slow poison in the drinks of her co-travelers. Later, she handcuffs the hands and ankles of her victims and ties them to their car with a rope. Then she enjoys the ride by brutally dragging them along the highway, first slowly and later at high speed, eroding them of their skin, flesh and bones one by one, until the point that only part of their skeletons are left.Absolutely no idea why the authors chose to write these stories, but I feel that they are one angle, inciting fresh sadistic and cruel ideas into the minds of the readers through such works. Any sensitive person might get heart stroke or nauseating effect while reading those parts of the book where the hunters enjoy the brutal murder process through their innocent victim&#8217;s extreme sufferings. Hope such people like Donaldson and Lucy do not exist in this world.Coming to the positive part of the short story, it is an indirect warning to road travelers on the following points from the authors.1: Don&#8217;t go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.2: Don&#8217;t pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be certifiably crazy.My rating is 2.5/5",Hitch-hiking is dangerous

The action is well described and nail biting in a few spots. The ending leaves satisfied enough but with some questions unanswered to keep you wanting more. There are plenty of paths that this story can take and it will be a great series to continue.The story was definitely well written with great characters that are believable and easy to understand. The only negative I can really say is that there were plenty of instances where the writer kept saying she (Abigail) just doesn't understand this or that, and then offers no explanation. So, I kept reading ""She just doesn't know or understand..."", and I kept thinking no crap - could you explain it?!? Never really got that many answers though - which I suppose is why it's a series and they need to do that so you'll get the other books. It was a good read and I would recommend it.",Good read...
987,"delivers less than promised by favorable reviewscharacters are shallowplot is banal and uninteresting.gave it two stars for grammar, punctuation andreferences to DanteCanterbury Tales gives more rationale for the pilgrims to travel togetherwith better character development and more layers of subplots.kept reading this with expectation that like Canterbury Tales, it would draw one into the storyshould have reread Chaucer.Deleted from my device after 85% through it.Could not like any of the characters enough to care what happened.",this is not worth the effort it requires to read it.
988,"Dylan Gennaro is a beta werewolf who spent years under a vicious alpha who enjoyed nothing more than hurting others.  It isn't until his friends and new home is threatened by Alan Matthews does he finally take a stand and kill his former pack leader.  Even now in is new home of Red Rock and under a much more kind alpha, Dylan is still pained by is inner scars from his previous life.  He does not just want to sit around and be taken care of by others but wants to help and be of use.Sasha Wallace watched as her mentor was savagely murdered and left with a few scars of her own but it's the ones that she can't see that hurt her more.  The citizens of Red Rock make her feel nervous and is under constant watch because of her magic.  One of the few that is able to calm and make her feel at ease is Dylan.  He saved her life and sees her as more than just a witch.  With every passing moment that they spend together, their attraction for one another grows.  But will Sasha stay in Red Rock long enough to explore her desire and feelings for Dylan or will she flee the moment she has repaid her debt?Dylan has been a character I've been interested in since the beginning of the series.  He is unselfish and will do whatever he can to help in the war with his former pack in Helena.  My only complaint is that I think he takes on too much of the blame.  He blames himself for what happen to Abby (story in Cry Sanctuary), her sister Brynn (story in Sanctuary Lost) and for the entire war.  It isn't until Sasha comes in that he finally takes a break from the self blame and his character becomes more than it has been.  He is not an alpha wolf but Sasha brings his wolf closer to the surface and I like that.  Sasha had been badly hurt and is terrified but with Dylan she is able to relax and feel safe and confident again.  There is some fight when it comes to admitting how she really feels (isn't there always?) but together, they begin to heal each others wounds.  I think what I like most about their relationship is that Dylan isn't dominate like an alpha would be toward his mate.  Not that there aren't protective instincts in him and he does want it known she is his, its just since he is more gentle with her the relationship is more charming and sweet than the ones in the previous books.Their relationship isn't the only event going on in the book.  It is brought to everyone's attention that there is an evil vampire working against them in the war.  Dylan and Sasha along with Joe and Brynn are sent to seek help from a vampire friend of Red Rock's alpha Gavin that lives in Maine.  When they get there they see that the pack has their own crises they are dealing with that includes an alpha trying to take over the pack and a female vampire that has an eye out for the blood and power inside of Brynn.  It was good to see Joe and Brynn again.  I enjoyed reading their story in Sanctuary Lost and I like to see my favorite characters make an appearance.  Brynn suffered a lot in the previous book and I liked that her and her struggle were included in this book.  I think I would have been a little disappointed if it wasn't.This book has a bit of everything.  Action, romance, steamy love scenes and sarcasm which is always one of my favorite things to read.  Sanctuary's Price is the third book in Moira Rogers' Red Rock series and is so far my favorite.  Each book is better than the one before and I have yet to be disappointed by anything from them.  I'm addicted to their characters, story and the world they built.  I can't wait for the the next installment in the Red Rock Series, Sanctuary Unbound.  Two words, lumberjack vampire.  Yup, not making that one up.",Favorite so far in the Red Rock series

993,"I borrowed this book because I love the author's With or Without and Sci-Regency series.  This had come very highly recommended to me, but to be honest, I didn't get into it as much as her other books.  The characters are well developed and the plot is believable, but something just struck me as off in this book.  I don't really know what it was just that it didn't engage me as much as the author's other books have.  I didn't have the same ""connection"" with the characters as I did in the other series.  I would definitely recommend borrowing before buying on this one.",Not Quite Up To Par For Me
994,"I was rather disappointed in this book. The writing--as far as vivid descriptions and sentence structure--was okay. The over all plot wasn't really that bad either. The problem was that it was set in the early 1800s, yet the vocabulary used (mainly referring to that for body parts and sex acts) didn't fit the century at all - way too modern. Why bother to research and use proper dialect and setting descriptors/situations elsewhere only to jolt the reader back to the 21st century with modern vernacular?  As far as I'm concerned, this book was a spaghetti bowl of sex tossed on top of a shaky frame of a plot by and author who could decide which century she was in.",Sex parading as a novel

I thoroughly enjoyed the parts about the siblings building and mending relationships.So to sum it up the best way I know how:Did the good outweigh the bad?

1009,"3.5 stars.I only read a couple of m-preg romance, and one I didn't like at all, the other had other themes which were more important and I liked it better. I was reluctant about this particular book. It was good, though. The process through which males can get pregnant and then give birth is explained in a way I found more believable and almost logical in the evolutive history of that world.I must confess that I thought the story would be more violent and angsty, but even if there was a lot of drama, it never really reached unbearable peaks. It was a bit difficult to get into the story at the beginning, because the odd names worked against my reading, then the story became more interesting, with political intrigue and heartache.The main couple was sweet, but unfortunately I wasn't really impressed. Lassen was too good, too passive. I think it was because he was conscious of his role as a concubine and didn't want to play outside his role at court. I didn't really like Rohyr, the King. At the end of the story, when many details were revealed, I couldn't help wondering why he did what he did.***spoiler*** The mate thing brought everything into perspective, but it was as if it came as a second thought, a bit out of nowhere, and I didn't feel it was worked into the story so well.***end spoiler***The world building was very interesting and rich. The author thought the hystory, politcs, biology, of these people in a very creative way. I would recommend it if you want to read about m-preg and you like fantasy. If you want your characters strong, it could be a bit disappointing.",3.5 stars. Rich world building

The three separate storylines are confusing at times, and it's just unbelievable that all three young women have men dripping off them. But many of the problems they face are similar to problems that my own twenty-something children are facing, so I didn't have any problem believing the rest of the book, and the stories kept me reading.

1018,I picked this up thinking it would be a short sexy story and it was certainly short. Other than that it was a total disapointment. Just don't waste your time. There was not character development or even romance. It was just a total waste of time and I was super disapointed.,skip this
1019,"Wow.  This is a story that had a ton of imagination behind it.  The idea was definitely inspired, and for once a newer author allowed the characters plenty of free reign.  The characters drive the action in this story, with their backstories and personalities meaning something.Sadly, the story desperately needed someone who could have reigned in the writers.Early chapters are flooded with ""info-dumps"" where several pages suddenly start explaining the planet the heroes are visiting, or some aspect of the technology in the universe.  This left the story rather disjointed, and the early chapters do not flow very well.Later the info-dumps diminish, only to be replaced by multiple page flashbacks.  The flashbacks are solidly written, tell rather complete tales, and probably would have been much better as their own seperate stories, in building towards this tale.  Some of them were definitely necessary to help reveal the personalities, but others again disrupt the flow of the story.The biggest problem though was the characters themselves.  Maeve and Coldhand both possess damaged psyches and events from their past drive their actions throughout the story.  This could have worked very well, but both are rather unsympathetic due to the extremely unflattering ways they are described.  Maeve as a broken junkie who refuses to allow anyone to become her friend and Coldhand's quiet madness due to the injuries that left him with a cybernetic heart and hand.And of course, as the first book of a trilogy, only a couple minor plot threads come to any kind of closure or completion.  The ending was more of a place that the story ran out of steam than a clear stopping point.Overall, this is not a very good book.  The writers have lots of talent and the story is impressive in its complexity and scope, but an editor was needed to weed out all of the asides that show up as info-dumps and flashbacks, and to tighten up the revelatoins of backstories so that they smoothly fit into the story rather than overwhelming the middle part of the story.  Even the appearance of the major antagonists could be improved as the enemy appears out of nowhere about 40% into the book.The sequel will be interesting, hopefully the authors will be less inclined to throw extra information at the reader but will continue to allow their characters to grow as the story develops.",Needed a lot of Editing
1020,"cute & entertaining, past it on as a read for friends and family lighhearted. I really ejoy this author, Stephanie Bod",Loved it
1021,"I generally do not enjoy books that include drug addiction and prostitution so I was a bit turned off at first. But I started to read the good reviews and was definitely curious.  Wow! I was pleasantly surprised. The Blood that Bonds is a great vampire tale that is a solid blend of conflict, romance, and tragedy. Very captivating and original. The author did a great job with the seedy side of addition (did not take it over the top) and did a great job with the romantic aspects of the story (also did not take it over the top).  His version of vampirism took a little from the norm with some added interesting twists (which probably are not original but not popular in most supernatural novels). Although some did not enjoy his writing style- there were a few parts that I found bland hence the four stars- I found his writing to be infinitely better than most e-books that I have downloaded and I am looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.",Wow... An Original Vampire Tale
1022,I really shouldn't rate this book since I could only get through very little of it. How freaking boring!!! I just had to give up completely.,I shouldn't
1023,"This book is truly remarkable. I'm not sure whether to give this to a scientist to dissect or a priest to exorcise. I have never seen a book so ungodly boring. It seems like the author wrote too much and it seriously wreaks havoc with the book. Most of the dialogue is exposition with a little character building shoved in wherever it would fit. From the situations that occur and the way they're handled most of the characters come off badly, with few redeeming qualities, and as awfully boring. I can't even remember their names.  As for the plot, what little of it there is revolves around a curse placed on the children of 2 families to cause conflict and a war, thus removing any responsibility the ""good guys"" might have in that horrendous affair. However most of the plot is shoved aside for world building, and while that may be fun for a bit, it gets old real fast. Another thing the more I learn about this world the less I want to read on, It is that unpleasant. There is nothing charming, magical or even realistic about it. This is by far the worst book I've ever read and the only barely redeemable thing about it is the opening. If I could give this zero stars I would. I'm sure this could be used as a form of torture in some circles of hell.",Remarkable
1024,"To honestly say, i was actually going to give this book a three rating. Why? Because first it was very slow, and made me desperate to get to the end (more like finish, and get it over with), because it just kept going on and on endlessly and I kept putting it off for a few days, and the fact that it wasn't my type of book to read (the cover lured me). To myself, I'm like ""When is the end coming?!"" It was too too long. And i felt like some parts were unneeded. Instead though i gave it a four star rating. Why? Because the story was sad. I wanted Jesse to live, and not just b part of her dreams in the end. I wanted him to live happy, and Sarah. The ending was not what i expected. I thought it'd be a happy ending. Well, it did, but seriously, I wanted him 2 stay alive. :(. The book almost left me in tears. After all he's been through, and what he's experienced, and that's what he gets in the end?? Not cool. Its worth a read, and i would recommend it. :). Good job Lowe.",Honestly....May contain spoilers...
1025,Not the type of Christmas story that I enjoy reading. Prefer more current day type of stories with women that have more charge of their lives.,Lost interest after first couple of pages.
1026,"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a trilogy, Vampire-themed Urban Fantasy/Romance. Overall pretty entertaining- story pulled me in, I liked the characters. Vampire mythology standard, but intricately described- politics between ""Houses"" is important. Note this is pure vampire, so you don't have any human perspective- they are predators, pure and simple. While romance was a constant theme, it was not the central plot and there is no sex. Violence is fast and bloody, but not overly gruesome. BE WARNED: Cliffhanger ending. You have to read book two for the rest of the story! (I haven't yet, but hear it's an even better book.)PLOT: Fast paced, excellently set up. I was really into the story until the last 25%. Things started out very well done, but fell apart at the end. The characters were thrown together and ran all over Europe in a romantic adventure, but eventually you had to ask ... when were they going to get some SOLID INTEL? Going into the last battle, we STILL didn't know who we were fighting or why. It was unsettling and bizarre and it led to the cliffhanger ending. It was ALMOST a great book, but reading to a cliffhanger when even you as the reader knew there was a problem is just f-ing frustrating. (See? It even made me swear!) This story arc could have used a little extra thought.CHARACTERS: Although slightly wooden, I really liked both Valentine and Prophecy. I attributed their slightly wooden natures to the fact that they were highly vampiric and not human at all. Despite that, they were very sympathetic. It was heart wrenching and thrilling to watch them grow close and ride out their emotional turmoil. Very well done on that front. Romance is teasingly light with barely a kiss, making the next book all that much more important!BOTTOM LINE: DESPITE my annoyance with the holes in the plot, I really did enjoy most of this book. I fully intend to continue to read this series and I notice Heaton has written other books set in the same ""realm,"" so I'll eat those up too!RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Katie Salidas'Immortalis Carpe Noctem- girl is turned after an attack and then tries to adapt and cope with a little bit of guidance from a sexy vampiric savior2. Jocelyn Drake's vampire/were/demon centric series full of grit:Nightwalker (Dark Days, Book 1)3. H.P. Mallory'sFire Burn and Cauldron Bubble: The Jolie Wilkins Series, Book 1- poor young woman accidentally discovers creatively drawn world of fae, vampires, weres and more. Weaker female character, but still well written4.

1030,"I really enjoyed this second installment in this series.  I just wish it had been longer.  I would also say that I liked the fact that this one, unlike the first, had chapter demarcations, even though it's short.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how close you are to the end of a chapter or to find a stopping place when you need to do so, although that's not much of a problem on short novellas.  The characters in this series so far are very realistic in my opinion.  I think this book had just the right amount of ""bits of everything"", except being so short.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the first book in the series, I think you'll like this one.  Give it a shot because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Have at it!  I can't wait to read the third and final one.",A cute and fun story with just a bit of intrigue and suspense
1031,"In Chicago, her five overly protective older brothers and her Italian parents are driving Lottie Santori crazy as they leave her with no breathing room.  Being the only female and the youngest, she enjoys any opportunity to escape from their constant vigil.  Thus she looks forward to her out of town work in Trouble, Pennsylvania to conduct on site research into a serial killer who owned Seaton House though she doubts she will find any sexual relief in the small town.At Seaton House, Lottie meets new owner Simon Lebeaux, who inherited the old hotel from his late uncle.  She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).  The trouble with this novel is that Leslie Kelly will keep her audience up late reading in one sitting.Harriet Klausner",delightful investigative romance

And to have her just fall into bed with Alex upon meeting him was totally unrealistic. She didn't know anything about him. He could have been an Axe Murderer for all she knew.

1038,"This wasn't a bad read but it was flat and under developed. There wasn't a strong conflict which made you anxious to turn the page. The premise of the book was that  Andreas, the H, blackmailed one of his employees, Saskia to pretend to be his fiancee so that his grandfather would not pressure him to marry his older cousin whom he really hated. Typical Harlequin plot which can still work if develop but the blackmailed centred around his accidental meeting with Saskia who was shamelessly flirting with him because she mistook him for her friend's boyfriend whose loyalty was being put to the test by Saskia and her friend.Andreas used this incident and the threat of losing her job to blackmail her to pretend to be the fiancee. This was to me a weak basis because her supervisor's report showed she was a top employee with a lot to offer the company and there was no basis to fire her. The h was compliant as she did not insist that he hear her side of the story and he and his cousin insulted her with little protest from her.Also, there could have been more interaction between H and h. There was too much narration, ie hearing what was going on in their heads but not much talking to each other. Because of this I couldn't believe that they fell in love and so quickly.I would still recommend this book but can only give it 3 stars.",Could have been better
1039,"Three roommates (Heath, Colt and Kylie - the only female) who have been best friends since college, engage in a game called Tequila Truth (started since they were in college and only occurs on each other's birthday) that starts to change their relationship when they each play the game on Health's 25th birthday.  Upon hearing Kylie's answer to the game, the three of them have been focused on how to fulfill the sex fantasy that each roommate can't seem to get out of their minds, but haven't admitted to each other.  What I enjoyed about this book is that the storyline is based on the strong and convincing relationship among these characters, combined with the steamy but meaningful sex scenes that were all male/female focused even though it was a menage.  The only minor concern I had on the story is how readily the characters addressed the LT impact of a menage relationship.  This story had it all, and I would recommend it if you want a steamy yet satisfying romance!",Tequila Truth - A Shot of Steaminess! - 4 1/2 stars
1040,"I thought this would be a great book after reading the description.  But, the author has put way too much filler in and that just turned me off. There are also lots of misinformation as to how things work out. For example:  He ambled!  Her senses hummed.  Women don't growl in dismay, they likely would sign or moan. Men don't glide, cattle bawl, they don't bray.  Mules and donkey bray!  And on and on.  I think the author had a good idea for a story, but she just had a first novel or juvenile attempt at this one. I got it free and I am happy at that.  Cannot recommend it.  Explicit sex is also a turn off.",Unbroken and not interesting.
1041,"Oh my gosh wasn't this one boring. There's the premise about the Endeavour blowing up, but the first three and a bit chapters were totally unrelated. I found myself getting progressively more and more bored as I read. When were they getting to what was detailed in the book's introduction? Not till chapter 4. Seriously, if you read this piece of rubbish, do yourself a favour and just read the prelude and then skip those 4 chapters. It is chapter 4 when things start to happen. But even then it isn't that exciting. And yes, it becomes a religious tome.I don't know what the writer was thinking with this one. Lure people in with a promise of a great sci-fi drama and then give them a boring religious book.Again, not my cup of tea regarding the religion, but even if it was, I still get the impression I'd find this one boring.",Bored the hell out of me
1042,"The name of Aubrey's coffee shop 'Bean There, Done That' is the perfect description of her love life.  Following her divorce she moved to Cedarville, Oregon where she's fit right into the community.  She has to marvel at the predictions of the homeless man who's taken up residence on the park bench across from her coffee shop - especially since inexplicably they keep coming true.It's eerie that Jericho's warning to 'beware of fire today' precedes the flames that wrecked havoc with her business.  Now she has to deal with an injured employee, cleaning up the mess, police reports and insurance claims - it's just all so overwhelming.  The last thing she needs is Jericho's prophecy 'you'll meet your soul mate today.'  Her failed marriage destroyed any illusion she had about soul mates or happily ever after.  That was a lesson in heartache she has no interest in repeating - not even with the new drool worthy police chief Price Delacroix.There's no denying the attraction between Aubrey and Price.  They're both divorced so he'd feel the same way as she does about marriage, right? Wrong!  Price's marriage might have been a failure but he's never given up his optimistic outlook on life and marriage.  He's convinced that Aubrey is absolutely perfect for him and while she's not looking for anything more than a little fun between the sheets, he's already planning their future together.  All he needs to do is convince her that he wants much more than a little mattress mambo.  The only way he can think of to get her to consider a real relationship is to cut her off - until she starts seeing things his way.Full of realistic characters, normal conflicts and a bit of mysticism, IF YOU BELIVE is an utterly charming story that kept me smiling as I visualized each situation in my head.  Aubrey's cynical attitude about love and happily ever after is countered by Jericho and Price's belief that anything is possible IF YOU BELIEVE.  In addition to these three memorable characters there&iexcl; a host of others who captured my interest and have me eagerly awaiting future titles in this series so that I can revisit Cedarville and find out what happens next.  The nosy busybody Mrs. Chambers' story comes next and then hopefully we'll see a story for Celia Occam and Mason Delacroix.  The tension between them practically explodes off the page so please, please Ms. Jordan, don&iexcl; make us wait too long :)IF YOU BELIEVE is the first book in Crystal Jordan's UNBELIEVABLE series.

1047,"Small town junior detective Elena O'Rourke is excited to get assigned lead in a murder investigation. The victim has an odd injury in his private parts--two small puncture wounds. And even odder he was drained of blood. One of her suspects, sexy Bo Strongwell keeps turning up everywhere. She just doesn't trust his story that he's part of the 'neighbohood watch' and that he's her sister's apartment 'building manager'. What's up with that? And why does he keep nibbling on her when they kiss? While working the case, she learns there's a lot going on in her town that she ever knew about--and her job is on the line!This book was just OK. The storyline of the book was pretty good, but it really needed a good line editor to suggest parts that could have been cut out and streamlined. It tended to drag and bog down in parts. I got tired of some of the repetitive stuff....like run ins with annoying Dirk, how many times we had to hear it had been five years since Elena had sex, etc. The character development was weak--I didn't connect with either of the main characters. I would have liked more development of the relationship between Bo and Elena. Seems like they had sex, and then boom they are supposedly in love.This is the second book I've read by Mary Hughes. Biting Nixie was the first, and I enjoyed it a good bit more than this one. It was much more funny, better paced, and had good character development.

1048,"3.5 Stars3/5 Hotness RatingKallysten has created a truly unique universe for her stories and this is only the second of her books that I've read that has been set in The Demons Age. I think that the setting and storyline for this time period is very exciting and adds a unique twist to an already fascinating world.Marc is a vampire that believes in the long ago made Pacts with the humans. He and his Childe, Blake, fight the demons but Blake does it because he thinks it's fun more than anything else. One night while they were fighting they came across a group of human fighters and decided to join forces with them. Among them was a soldier named Kate to whom both found themselves attracted. I guess it was game on between those two from then on. There's nothing like a little rivalry when vying for a woman's attention.The relationship between Marc and Blake is something new to me. I've read a decent amount of Kallysten's creations and I've never come across a Sire/Childe relationship quite like their's before. The parent/child feel isn't there. Marc doesn't force Blake to obey in any way. In fact, Blake's a total pain in the ass. He's always trying to push Marc's buttons and he's awfully immature despite his many decades of life.The three main characters in this book were written extremely well. To put it simply, the were brought to life for me through Kallysten's words. It was like I was watching the story play out before my eyes. I was able to feel Kate's confusion over her conflicting emotions for the two vampires. I disliked Blake's childlike behavior towards Marc. When Marc felt exasperated by Blake's antics I was right there with him and I can easily envision myself smacking Blake upside the head. I love it when a read feels real like that.Since this is only the first in a trilogy about the same set of lovers, a lot of the book was built on the character building. As you can tell, I think Kallysten did a fabulous job with it. I missed the smoldering love scenes though. The scene between Marc and Blake was brief and the other scene in the story was only a murky dream. I look forward to reading the next book and getting deeper into the attraction between the three.",A Good Start

1055,"This story is about a woman. Jane. Who is a submissive. She is in the bondage and submission scene. She is a sexually mature woman. She embraces what it is to be a fully sensual and sexual woman. This book described her first let's say unsuccessful relationship with a Dom. Peter Ellington is a charismatic Dom. He was her first Dom. He was also married. He screwed it up. He was not clear in the aspect that he was already married. Yep he was a jerk. She is going to a masked surprise party that she helped to plan. She is a professional party planner with her friend Lily. There the two set out to have some fun. Her friend with some guys. Who she is flirting with. But, there is this one guy she calls him JJ. They get on each other's nerves. They got some major chemistry going on there. They absolutely refuse to acknowledge at all. But low and behold they will. Then there isAntonio Villareal. A hot sexy as hell Spanish vintner. Who is on his way to making his first billion dollars. He was a young millionaire. He made it on his own.The author managed to really seduce entice you into bdsm. She takes away the fear.  She made Antonio seduce me.",Very seductive beginning.
1056,"I started reading this book without knowing exactly what it was, but the first lines already caught me. The beginning is almost traumatic. Everything happens in one long sentence and at that point you have to go on to find out what happens next.The story is about an American who is forced to work for a Mexican gang who traffics drugs across the border with the United States. You see the character's ascent from common man, who must count on his expertise to make himself indispensable to his new ""boss"", thus avoiding his own death and that of her daughter, to expert trafficker and unscrupulous criminal.The rhythm is that an action story, but the suspense is typical of a thriller. While accompanying the character to his descent into hell, one wonders how he will ever get out of that situation, and from time to time our theories are proved wrong by the latest turn of events.The very title of ""Borderline Case"" has the double meaning of referring to a geographical border and to a borderline patient, emphasizing the dual reading of the story.Although told in third person, in fact, the novel follows almost exclusively the main character, Eric, except for some scenes, so you end up deeply understanding and sympathizing for him. The other characters are almost all portrayed in a rather superficial way, perhaps deliberately not to distract too much the reader from the main problem (the survival of Eric) and make sure they won't mind if they got killed. Which happens often.If it were a movie in theaters, I would say that the ticket costed very little, if the price is divided by the number of deaths. And this aspect, if we talk about drug trafficking and especially action, is undoubtedly positive.Really an excellent reading.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return",Action and fun
1057,"Great read.  Yes we know Cody had a tendancy to make it more of a story and less of a report, but still a very readable and enjoyable book on the plains life.  I agree that it really trailed off at the end and we did not get much of a glance of the traveling show years, perhaps because that was so often wrought with financial problems, other than that it was good to read this again since I had not read it since early teen years.  And on kindle it is $0......can't beat it if you like reading about the West.",Recommended reading if you like the West
1058,"The author seems to have serious issues. Getting Amazon to delete honest reviews is wrong. Blaming others because I didn't like your book is wrong. I can't help that you book sucks, it does. Man up. It's because of books like yours that I stopped reviewing things for the longest time. I ran across so much junk, like this. This was so poorly done I must have erased the memory of reading it from my mind. I almost was sucked into buying it again when Amazon reminded my I already bought it. Sure enough there it was on my kindle. I started reading again and remembered why I scraped it out of my brain.If there's a bottom of the bad barrel, this one's sitting at the very bottom. In a land where characters are named March and Brendley and Jenka De Swasso (no not making that one up), no one says anything they hiss words, they jest words, they plead words, they mumble words, they shrug words, they sigh words, they scold words, they instruct words, and they even look around words.I wish I was making it up, but apparently the author doesn't realize characters can't shrug words or look around words. And as far as ending dialogue properly goes, that's the least of the big misses. So how in the hell is this or anything the author's written rated so highly?",Give this author a pass. I'm physically ill after reliving the horror that was this book.

1061,"As has been pointed out in some of the other reviews, this has alternating point of views between the hero and heroine, and its written in the first person for the heroine's sections. The effect was jarring to me, and I really wanted to skip whole chapters, especially when she's describing her own body as ""hot"" and centerfold worthy. Made her a lot less likable.  Then there are the continuity issues. In chapter 3 her internal monologue includes, ""Mr. Lebeaux. God, I didn't even know his first name.""  Then a few pages later ""the portable lantern Simon had left..."" half a page later ""hoping Simon would suddenly remember..."" so you think, well maybe she does know his name after all. Then in the next chapter she asks him ""What's your name?...Your first name."" There's a couple of other gaffs too but that one nearly made me give up on the book.The heroine goes back and forth between contemplating how many guys she's been with in college to then saying things like ""I don't have a lot of experience at this,"" when she's underneath the hero. The first half of the book as so many pages about her talking about being ""horny"" that you just want to tell her to get a life.I've read the other books in this series and they were okay.

I'm going to have to do something to make it stand out. I wish that there were other color options for it. Of course, I knew it was black going in, so I have no cause to complain.

As for Mike, I thought it a little different that he wanted a committed relationship from  the get go when he really only knew Annabelle based on her looks.  I would liked a little more development of their relationship before he was ready to marry the girl!  The sex scenes are not too graphic but certainly steamy.

However when she meets Gabe's best friend, Connor, she's torn between the attraction she feels toward him and the already structured relationship she shares with Gabe.Connor Regan and Gabriel Carter have shared their women several times over the years.  Neither of them sees any foreseeable problem with sharing Maddie - especially since her playful demeanor and body's reactions show that she is attracted to both men.What none of them could have guessed is that the attraction between Connor and Maddie is more than just physical.  She shares an emotional bond with him that she's never felt with Gabe but that doesn't change the facts that she is Gabe's girlfriend.

1089,"First, I want to say that Lauren Dane's Cascadia Wolves series is my all-time favorite! I own them in print, and also have them on my Kindle.  I was eager to read this book as well.  However, the D/s element was just too strong a part of the story for me. I can skim over some minor bondage stuff, but this was just too much for me. If you like a D/s relationship, then it won't bother you.  But, if like me, it's not your cup of tea, I thought I would post a review and let you know just how strong an element it is in this book.",Not my cup of tea
1090,"Other reviewers were right on the money when they pointed out that this book could have benefited tremendously from quality editing, particularly if the editor had the sense to tell the author that some of his writing quirks were patently ridiculous. The main characters' first and last names are used nearly every time they are mentioned, and they call each other by first and last name almost as often. If that was intended to be cute mannerism it didn't work.Large portions of this book were completely unrealistic and disjointed, even for a book that one automatically approaches with a certain level of suspended belief. The characters should have had potential, but never lived up to it.The (very small) part about them actually finding the ark was interesting, but also completely failed to live up to its potential. It was surprisingly brief and largely ignored for the rest of the book, despite supposedly being at the center of the story. I finished the book, but won't read anything else by this author and suggest other readers not waste their time.",Strange

Chance brings Kelsey into the father and daughter's lives.  Bringing these three people together makes their story an enjoyable and interesting  read.  The author,  makes each character  realistic.

This story is about Aunt Millie from ""Letters to a Secret Lover"" it was very short, 35 pages, a cute, sweet read. It reminded me of the Grease era, Johnny with his ducktail hairdo and leather jacket- very reminiscent of Danny, Millie- the sheltered, virginal Sandy.

It was a page turner.I loved the setting, the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina near Virginia. The characters were believable. The story begins with a funeral.

Carla's new boyfriend, Kevin, was the nephew of that man, Jack Dawson - and Jack had just moved back to town!  As the story continued, the things that had happened over those thirty years to both people, the reasons why things had happened as they did, all were made known.

1119,"The Jynx by K.C. Crowe is presented as a modern take on ""The Old Man and the Sea"".  While Billy's story has a different twist (as per the synopsis) the beginning just felt too darn familiar in texture to Hemingway's work.  This distracted me from fully appreciating Billy's own story.The flat storytelling, with its detailed focus on mundane matters, is one that I generally find interesting, as it highlights the author's skill as a writer and ability to engage to reader in the base-humanity of the lead character's life.  This author does a fine job of accomplishing that.A comment:~Of the first 15 sentences 12 began with they, he, Billy, Sweeney or the dog.  I usually don't notice stuff like this, but it was troubling to see this lack of diversity right off the bat.  It went away as the excerpt progressed, but was simply glaring in the beginning.I'm right on the fence as to whether I'd be interested in reading more of this book.  On the one hand I feel too familiar with what I've already read, while on the other hand, the author's writing and promised story premise piqued my interest enough to possibly go on.",Clamming is Not Enough to Chase Away Similarities

Although the storyline goalposts seem to keep changing and the ending a bit sudden and far-fetched, I am sure many readers will enjoy the ride.

He insisted she'd handle this particular case of breaking and entering to prove to the owner that they were the better security company. All goes well until Jodi gets caught and cuffed between two men.That's the smattering of plot, and pretty much the extent of my enjoyment of the novella. It had its moments but deflated pretty quickly. There wasn't really any foreplay-you know, the part that's supposed to turn people on-and only the setting itself was intriguing.Had the author chosen an honest roleplay option I would have enjoyed the erotica part more, but Braemel chose to underline Jodi's insecurities and all the things that made her an unlikeable character to me. The author also chose to wrote lengthy explanations on why would a normal, usually a quite vanilla, woman acquiesce to participate in a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with her boyfriend and a man she'd never met before. I'm assuming this was done to lure in the threesome newbie readers, and I'm assuming the pandering in the end was written for them too.For me, it didn't work. The sex got boring after the first nipple sucking and the attempt to add plot and justification for a couple taking a one night lover pretty much ruined any and all respect I had left for the characters. Any of them. It's safe to say that without heavy-handed recommendations from my friends, I won't be reading more of Leah Braemel's work.",Criminally boring for an erotica.

As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read. The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed. The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow. Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other.

1141,"I think this is worth reading. I am not a big fan of the novella form- characters are usually one dimensional, stories seem rushed or overly simplistic and a little bit of background can read as dry as a law review when you are anxious to get back to the story. So I went into this expecting that. In the end, I found it didn't manage to avoid falling into those pitfalls, but I found I was pleased to have been introduced to the mythology of this world.This one was a little bit better than many novellas- the imagery is beautiful. Anyone who has spent time in a jungle would appreciate it. Very magical setting.The characters were not developed at all- I barely managed to put together a mental image of what they might look like, but the sex was hot and their attraction was palpable. Maggie and Brandt were likable enough, though you had to work hard to overlook his blatant deception that set off the whole thing. For the sake of the novella form, a reasonable back and forth between the two that would have allowed the relationship to develop had to be sacrificed. In places the passion short circuited rational thought, but Ms. Feehan managed to maintain the integrity of both characters.The best part of this, as I mentioned, was the mythology. Ms. Feehan has created a wonderful concept here. The environmental message was laid on a little thick, but overall it was a good concept to quickly win the heart of the reader.Anyone who is familiar with Ms. Feehan's work will recognize this isn't her best work, but it is a fast read that opens a door to a series that has great potential for passion.",Just the introduction...

When she comes back to her room, she's comatose, but not in ICU, not on a ventilator, and there are no nurses around.The father decides he needs to help someone, so he wanders corridors of a hospital with no interference from anyone, makes his way into an adolescent psychiatric unit (which has apparently no security nor locked entrances) spends 5 minutes with a suicidal teenager (who is alone--seriously?) and miraculously, the teenager decides not to kill himself. (Psychological therapy is obviously inadequate to the situation.) Not only does the teen decide to live, but he goes to all the other adolescent patients and convince them life is worth living.THEN the little girl's physician, who has been totally intimidated by the father, offers a job to the high school dropout father, training him to be a counseling therapist. Just like that.Maybe the author should have just told the story of Greg as it happened, how it effected him, and published it as a short story. I'm sure that would have been much more interesting. And believable.Thank goodness it was a freebie.",Ridiculous.
1161,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it, my first thought was ""Is that all there is?"". The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella, which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story, but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it.",Pleasant read but not much too it.
1162,"This author has quickly become one of my favorites!  Her books are well written, with good character development and lots of steamy love scenes!This book is shorter than her other books, but it definitely keeps you entertained the whole way through.  I'm looking forward to her next novel!",Easy read!  Great book!
1163,This was entertaining. It seems it could have been the inspiration of the TV series LOST. So many things are so alike.,Mysterious Island
1164,The story starts strong but then turns predictable. There are much better shifter novels out there. I think it is over priced for the amount of content.,Short and predictable
1165,I've read all the Halle Puma books and this one was no exception. Dana Marie Bell is a fantastic shifter romance novelist.,Loved them all...
1166,"I was so disappointed at how this story turned out. Chandra, the female main character came across as strong and determined. She was a top notch detective that kicked butt to rise to the top of her field.When her friend goes missing she sets out to find her. In her search she winds up at a vampire club and meets Sin who advises her that her friend is at his mansion and he will take Chandra there. Once she gets there he ""seduces"" her ( if you can call it that) and from then on throughout the rest of the book Chandra is a complete and total idiot.Sin tells her he wants total dominance over her. She insists she cant do that but her clothes fall off at the sight of Sin or his brothers. And they pass her around like a piece of meat through out the story. And the bad part is that she thinks they are doing her a favor because she's full figured and they are handsome and she cant live with out sex with Sin and the brothers too.The story ends with her giving in to Sin and in proving to him that she will be completely submissive she allows him and his brothers to screw her in front of a whole night club full of vampires. And she gives up her career also. Just so she can be free to be used up by Sin and his brothers.There is definitely a limit to submission and Chandra went way past that.I'm not sure what the author was trying to get across with this story but I was just totally disappointed with it.",Very Disappointed
1167,Just seemed like this one had too quick an ending and the heroine's acceptance of what was required of her to keep her man was even faster than the... um... climax.,Too quick
1168,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However, there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK, the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in ""Man of Steel.""",Fast-paced and exciting!
1169,"Jake is a rich and successful business man. Emily is his Executive Assistant.  Jake sees Emily is a very hard working, efficient and a loyal employee, average looking (which is good, no office romances allowed).  He doesn't seem to notice but everyone around him notices how Emily is very attractive in her own way.  Emily is trying to meet people to date and suddenly Jake feels the need to be protective and ""responsible"" for her.  He offers to introduce her to people he knows and to teach her everything she needs to find someone appropriate to date.  The more time he spends with her, the more he realizes how much he wants to keep her just for him.The banter was so fun in this book.  Some situations were so funny. It was a well written book. It was a very fun and entertaining read.  Read it in a day as I couldn't seem to be able to put the book down. Very cute and sweet!",Very cute and fast read!

Read to find out what that one way was.",Super Series
1171,"Tessa blows into Darinthian Ambassador Kortal's office looking for her missing sister on his home planet where people are ""linked"" by magic - as Tessa and Kortal are now, according to some gut feeling of his.  Apparently, this means now that she's entered his domain, she's surrendered to whatever he wants, which he tells her is her ""body, mind and spirit.""Moments after he tells her this, she's inexplicably, violently crazed with lust until he satisfies her (quite easily), then as she tries to fight him, he subdues her with sex again, then he builds her up and demands she wears his collar, which she agrees to in a haze of lust.  He ties her up because he knows when the magic wears off, she'll be ticked off and try to leave him before he can do the sex mojo thing on her again.It's all explicit and if you like that kind of thing without it being necessarily erotic or having any emotional element, than you'll enjoy this.  Tessa and Kortal have absolutely no emotional connection; she's his possession from the moment she walks into his office and she's struck deaf and dumb with lust immediately because of some super mind-bending ability of his; when he's not around, she comes to her senses, then loses them again when he returns.This is from Ellora's Cave, and if you're familiar with them, this particular story would fit with their Exotica collection in my opinion (it contains stories that are more unusual, push boundaries and don't necessarily include affection or happily ever afters), although I don't think this writing is up to par with the authors that are generally included in that series.",Mind controlling magic masquerading as erotica

1174,"This story is 'told by the author' rather than experienced by the reader. It's an eye-opener to the lifestyle of immigrants who follow ancient cultures and beliefs even while in this country -- at least as told from the perspective of a child's experience. I'm sure the pain and suffering descriptions are accurate at least for some people, but it's hard to read, hard to track what time period is being described, and sometimes hard to figure out who is on stage.","Tough reading, definitely not for pleasure"
1175,"Nothing better than a rip roaring family stand-off to spice up weekend reading. Luc father, Maurizio is a dinosaur hell-bent on his version of Greek tradition being honoured, though he himself is far less honourable in his methods.Luc is gutted by his brother's  and father's betrayal of his love for Skye, not to mention the son they hid from him and comes in guns blazing to a blistering, scorching confrontation with Maurizio. And bluntly defies his family to woo back the love of his life and their son.Lots of layers to unpeel, more blistering showdowns for this family to work their way through. I love this alpha male, prepared to defy and dis-own his Greek family to put Skye and Matt first. And I love that Skye makes Luc earn the right to her trust and love but she also grows to understand the tenacious pride of culture and traditions, despite being far from home.Very satisfying - one of the few novels to survive another culling from my library.",I adore the epic family dynamics

1198,"No SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: This is a short story that reads like the opening chapters of an over-dramatized paranormal romance. There was some magic: magical ring, legend of werewolves come to life in a whimsical way. Overall, however, it was pretty unsatisfying.SEXUAL CONTENT: While it is labeled as ""erotic"" - there was really only one scene of lust and it was just OK. It was sexy in a desperate kind of way, but felt incomplete.PLOT & CHARACTERS: Not really much plot and the story was so short that pacing was irrelevant. Mostly this was just incomplete. It read like a vignette, not a story. The characters were undeveloped, though the man was intriguing. It might have been fun to get to know him better through a longer story.BOTTOM LINE: This story is one word: HARMLESS. Nothing really to it, but nothing terribly against it except that it was too short. If this had been developed into a real book, it might have turned out to be ""just ok."" As it is, though- not worth reading.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series2.

But I am afraid this book is so short that I wouldn't bother with down-loading it. In reality, it is a few pages describing a sex scene. There is no story to support the sex.

He (BECHETT DeSAXBY) is also in my top 5 Hero/daydream inducing gents.Didn't expect to like it. Seemed a little too debauched. ha ha ha. I freggin loved it. Matter of fact I'm over 21...well over 21...ran my batteries dead..NOW you know what batteries..I am broadening my reading tastes and buying anything Scottie Barrett writes. AN ABSOLUTE KEEPER (with a large supply of batteries).And for once the cover of that hunk matched the description. You guys can read it premise. What I loved is his portrayal and the FILET MIGNON in depth character study Scottie Barrett did. From the first, with 'Bechett baby' catchin a snooze in the hayloft after an early ""happy ending"" thats AFTER HE WENT OUT AND BROUGHT BACK HIS CASTLE'S meat for the week. At first he seemed like a wastrel. But he's the real deal. In modern times he would be a war hero. He's home from the crusades. He didn't think he would survive. The King suitably and righteously rewards him. He's in his early 30's. Very responsible and loving and enjoyin life. (HELL, I'M WELL OVER 21 AND I'D DO THE SAME THING)He earned it. It's his choice. And he takes it to the max.As I said I'm not doing story premise, but it's about 3 friends. 2 boys and 1 girl. Bechett baby is one of the boys, then his cousin (the other boy) and a girl.They were all raised together. He fell in love with the girl as children. Then life happens. The first scene AFTER he gets her back inside the castle walls...well....hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm.She is tricked into delivering some refreshments to his bedroom..and she walks in on a REAL TREAT! CRIPES MY OWN HEART RATE JUST PICKED UP,HONESTLY! For the faint of heart, she walks in on a Mfff, Ah-hem (can't breath)...she's stuck on stupid..I'm not! I must have read this scene 100 times and it still hasn't gotton old. I can just see his face when he turns around...luv,luv,luved it! So there's my re-wright. I've re-read this 3x's. I've only done that with 3 other books. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LOVED THIS ONE. And for those of you whe know me from the other Amazon sites know I'm no shrinkin violet.So those of you who read the 1st version..throw it out..try this! YES YES YES this is a keeper,a heat inducer, and in MY top 5. (Now let's see where did I put my new toy?",Wiggleliscious/new toy ready/!!

Sky is a rock star, traveling incognito, trying to avoid the paparazzi.  He came to town for a few weeks for some quiet time to write music.  He happens to be in the pub when Teagan performs.  He likes her song and asks her to be a cowriter, working with him to write some songs.  At first she refuses, but then agrees after losing a bet to him about music knowledge.  They spend a lot of time together.  They are sexually attracted to each other.  She is a virgin and wants to wait until she falls in love before having sex.  He respects that, so they play with each other sexually without taking her virginity.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I wasn't surprised or delighted with anything.  The characters, dialogue, and plot were ordinary, nothing new.  It wasn't bad.  I kept reading out of curiosity, but I wasn't drawn in.  Although he is protecting her virginity, he gets into some kinky sexual things right away which was odd.

If my pure love for them wasn't enough, add those scorching sex scenes and you got a banger baby!!I love how this story focused solely on them. With exception for the chapter that gave us a brief view on the Doc, it was all Z and Bella with Nalla. They are the cutest little family, and who would have thought that Z would have been the first to carry on the line of Aghony and the aristocrats? Not me!It was like watching Z and Bella fall in love again. It also gave us an update and dose of reality as to where Z is in his recovery. He's not as far as I suspected at the end of 'Lover Awakened'.  He s struggling and with even more baggage.Even though Mary has paled quite considerably since 'Lover Eternal', the brothers never take a weak female. As such, it's good to see the fruits of Mary's labour and I always love it when she and Z get together. Whether learning or therapy, those two got a rhythm that no one else has with Z, not even Bella. Maybe it's her training, but Mary definitely knows how to handle him.I don't know T.W. and we might never see him again, but I love the man and what he stands for. His moment with his wife was precious, and was a slice of life outside of the supernatural, something that has been missing and slipping as this series grow.An update was also provided on the other members of the brotherhood, however minimal. Phury is back how I remember and respect him, even if he isn't fighting, and it was good to get back out in the field with the brothers. Their tactics and battles always fascinated and intrigued me. I loved 'Dark Lover' where we got more fighting than romance. There was plotting, scheming and failure. I secretly would have liked at least some action from Mr. D, but then again, this novel was about love, reconciling and building new bridges.I searched without seeing a book for Nalla, but I already love the young and anticipate spending time with her uncle Rehvenge in the next novel. Hopefully we get some more Bella and Z time from this, however small :)",Another slice of Bella and Z with Nalla!

The beginning  was ok getting into it and next thing I know they are having sex which is ok because I don't mind I like erotica, but they kept going at it sex, sex with freaky stuff him mixing things with her private parts, more sex. I think they came up for air but who knows.3. After they met, the rest of the book was filled with sex, then the end. I guess the story is about the emerald but the title should have been called ""lets see how many times we can have sex by the ocean and be freaky with it"".

1215,"If I could give this story 3 1/2 stars instead of 3, I would have. This is basically a love story about a physically & mentally damaged guy who has pretty much stayed in the shadows due to his deformity. That doesn't stop him from getting what he wants - whether success in the financial world or his share of women. His main thing is not letting anyone close to him.Well...along comes Katie who has become an object of his desire and lust due to a self-portrait of her that he purchased from the coffee shop she works in. Of course she becomes his current challenge to get her into bed. However, he hasn't ever encountered someone like Katie - she meets him head on in his sexual whims and desires but she is also a pure loving soul who sees past his deformity. She's not out to get anything from him except his love. In the first half of the story, I was a little taken aback by how easily Katie fell into his sexual wishes so soon and sudden. Cain came across a bit like a stalker, lurking in the night - but it was understood that he preferred the darkness of the night so he could hide his deformity. He also came across as hot and cold and it was puzzling to Katie.Of course since he doesn't believe he is deserving of her love, he initially pushes her away with cruel and cold words. But credit has to be given to Katie - she didn't slink away or let his mean words push her away..initially. I kept thinking that if someone said those means things to me, I would have been gone in a flash. But because she didn't let his words push her away, he started to see the relationship in a different light. But of course his demons kept coming out and eventually it did accomplish in pushing her away.The second half of the story was simply a realization. It takes a true love to take you out of the darkness and into the light...but only if you can see it in yourself that you are worthy of being loved. Love isn't easy - when you find that love you have to hold on. And that's what Cain comes to realize in the end. The book started off with light BDSM and turned into a deeper story of love.",Beauty and the Beast love story

1217,"Well, if you like reading about erotic threesome encounters with two hunks than this is the book for you. Most of it was not practical being the ladies first encounter but it is short and sweet.  I would have liked to pay less to read it but what else is there to do on a  rainy afternoon. I would have liked a much longer book with more of a story line with the erotosism sprinkled throughout instead of on every page.  I may look into the rest of the series to see if it all ties in. Enjoy.",Negative Nelly Here
1218,"There was no storyline to review, this was like a short porn story. The characters had no personality and there was no story. There were short sex scenes and thats all. The female character lets an unknown man touch her intimately while she is virtually unconcious with no objections whatsoever. She actually liked it..unbelievable and unreal. I know these are fantasies but never will that be a believable fantasy for any woman I know.",No story
1219,"I love this series, but I can't say I really ""enjoyed"" this story. However, it is absolutely the finest portrayal of the dense male I've read in a long time. This guy doesn't get the concept of ""Actions speak louder than words,"" or that maybe if your mate and all of your loyal friends tell you you're making a few mistakes you should listen to them. But nope, not our hero. He just doesn't comprehend why everyone doesn't just accept how absolutely right he is about everything. For someone chosen to be a member of an elite shifter version of Special Forces, this lack of judgment seems like a major liability.I did enjoy rolling my eyes at this guy's stupidity, as well as the appearances of the characters from previous books. On the down side, his ""little friend"" in this book (who pretty much derails his relationship,) also figures into the new series, Halle Shifters. I cringe to think that she will be an important character there, as she is selfish, immature and not at all likable. Unfortunately, she was given a ""special connection"" to a really great secondary character. What's with her and these ""special connections"" to the male characters? Maybe we'll get lucky and she'll mature some. Otherwise, I doubt the new series will be as enjoyable as the previous books. I do highly recommend Bear Necessities, (the first book in the new series,) and luckily she's unconscious throughout most of it!",Best Dense Male Ever!

1222,"This short story takes place in an alternate universe. How would have World War 2 progressed if magic was real? What if there were mages, dragons, necromancers, etc. fighting side by side with humans?The story started ok and then the 'tempo' picked up and it became a rather good story. The best part, and the part that won me over, there were zombies! The story is very descriptive and you can picture the battlefield as you read along. I enjoyed being able to visualize the scenes as I read the story.As another reviewer said, ""this is only a teaser."" I want a sequel, prequel and more stories!",It had me at zombies

1225,"This is the first book I've read by Cooper Davis, and it seemed...fine. I know that's not a rousing endorsement, but in this genre, it actually kind of is. I liked the two characters, Max and Hunter. They were sweet and fun. The story was another ""straight guy goes gay"" story. Those can be fun, but often feel very contrived to me. This one was fairly light on plot, too. There was a lot of exploration of, primarily, Hunter's feelings and fears, but no real conflict. It was also kind of sweet that Max could read Hunter so well, but at times it seemed almost intrusively psychic when he'd take one look at Hunter and say something extremely specific that exactly addressed whatever bit of angst Hunter was feeling at the moment. I think the thing that was the most distracting for me was that the book was written in the present tense. That's really unusual and pulled me out of the story once in a while.Wow, all that sounds like I didn't like this book. I did. It was fun and light. The sex scenes were nicely done, too. And it was perfect for a quick summer read.",Short and light...
1226,This book could only be a joke.  Which man is going to allow other men to grope and fondle the woman he is about to marry.

1228,"It's hard for me to say exactly how I felt about this book. Would I recommend it? Maybe to my dad or grandparents. The book was solid and the mystery plot decent, but I felt overwhelmed by info dump and mundane aspects. I found myself just wanting to be through the book so I could be done with it and start another. Yet at the same time I wouldn't say the book was 'bad'. There were parts which held my interest and honestly I was surprised how things turned out. But the description of every meal, every movement around a kitchen to make said meal left me...skimming for the meat of the book. If you are forty/fifty and under, I think you'll find the book slow/dull. If you are late 50's- 60+ or need to pick a present for that age range - this would make a good gift.","Better suited for seniors? Solid 2.5 stars, not 3...amazon fix this?"

1231,"I liked this book but I didn't understand what his problem was.  He never asked her to marry him when he proposed her going to England.  It was more like he wanted to continue on as they were just that he wanted her closer to hand.  Then he got all vindictive when she said no.  Crimeney!!  What was up with that?  Of course he meets up with her again and decides to seek revenge.  Um . . . for WHAT???  Because she didn't wanna be a permanent mistress?  He never said the ""M"" word let alone the ""L"" word when they knew each other before.  The man set down the rules, then decided to change them, and forgot to tell her!  Once you get past his poor me thing the book was pretty good.  Francesca and Angelo really had some chemistry and you were left rooting for the two of them.  Especially when she set aside her pride and fessed up to why she didn't think she was good enough for him.",He never asked her to marry him
1232,Let me start by saying I like Sierra Cartwright and have read several of her books...but this was beyond my comfort level. The male lead in this book was cold and distant. He controlled everything for a week with no real emotional connection or formation of a personal relationship beyond complete control. Then all of a sudden they are in love and want to get married. I just didn't buy into the story and yes it was beyond my comfort level. This will not stop me from purchasing another Cartwright book. This one just didn't do it for me.,too much for me
1233,"These books are all about the same.  Many were produced in the early years of the 1900's, and paint a picture of lives as slaves.  They were recorded before the people who actually lived this life passed away.  So they are snapshots of an historical way of life, which was varied, as there were &#34;good&#34; masters, and &#34;bad&#34; masters.  The level of education of various slaves is apparent.  Some were quite illiterate, and simple, while some were relatively sophisticated, depending on what the masters encouraged.",One of Many Slave Narratives
1234,I really enjoyed this story. I loved the different twists and combinations of supernatural beings. This was fresh and different and I loved it!,Wow!
1235,"Detective Chandra Hunt receives a cryptic message that says if she wants to see her friend again, to go to a night club on the edge of town and seek out the Stoner brothers. But she has to go alone...or else. Her friend Val has been gone a month with no clues to her whereabouts. As the first lead, she's determined not to screw it up. So she goes, and meets one of the sexiest men alive.Sin-Bad Stoner is an old vampire who believes he's finally found the one woman who can fulfill his every need and desire. Unbeknownst to her, the brown-skinned beauty has been the subject of all his thoughts and efforts for a long time and it looks like those efforts are finally paying off.  However, she's not about to surrender quietly. So he'll just use all his vampiric wiles to lure her to his home and dominate her until she does.As a reviewer and as a reader, I've long loved everything vampire and everything BDSM:  The darker and edgier the better. When I saw this book contained both those subjects, I was intrigued. After all, what could be more compelling than an uber dominant vampire?  There were references in the story that Sin did not use any mind tricks to compel Chandra to remain with him that first night, or to like the sex they shared. But it did seem, all the same, that she was trying to fight her natural inclination to get away from him.Sin was not a very likeable character, sad to say. All throughout the story, he waxed on and on about the size of his package, but it was actually difficult to discern which was larger: that, or his unbelievably inconsiderate arrogance. On the one hand, he anonymously sent Chandra gifts before they met, so one would think his desire was to romance her. But then, after they met, he expected her to automatically capitulate blindly to his whims and desires. At one point, he even demanded she eschew all her thoughts of upholding the law as was her credo as a police officer and blindly submit to his dominance. And when she wouldn't do what he asked, he would toss her declarations of love back in her face, saying that she would do it if she loved him, reminding me of a petulant school bully, rather than a dark and intense vampire regardless of his origins.With Sin's two other sexy brothers, and a delicious premise, I really wanted to like Night of Sin but I just couldn't get past his boorishness to like the rest of the story. Because it had such promise, I find myself wanting to read other works by Marilyn Lee. I refuse to give up on this author after one read. After all, others might enjoy it, but I'd recommend giving it a pass.",Night of Sin

1239,"This was a short, entertaining read. I don't know that I'd classify it as erotic but it is a steamy fantasy story. Dardanus is definitely an anti-hero and not exactly likeable in the beginning. Because of the short length of this story, it's hard to say much without giving away spoilers, but The Knife's Edge is a sensual read about Queen Nestra and Dardanus. While many in the kingdom seem to consider the Queen fragile and not deserving of the throne (Dardanus is one of those people at first), she's a woman looking to give up control in the bedroom, trust someone for once and have someone see her for herself and not her title. Even though the entire story is told from Dardanus' point of view, all that came across clearly which I think says a lot about Ms. Draven's storytelling ability. I was completely engrossed in this story and if this is an example of her writing, I will definitely be looking for more by her.","Short, entertaining fantasy read"

Both main characters where great I love all what Zack did, very sneaky but smart. Arielle was not a push over she was strong where she needed to be but gave in when she needed too. I love that they where made for each other perfect. I loved this book and can say it was worth reading. Enjoy......",worth reading

1243,This book drags!  I am a patient reader but this book drags and takes forever to build any kind of relationship between the two main characters.  Add to that the slow trickle of information and you have the making of a slow and apathetic romance novel.  Will not read the series.,This book drags!
1244,"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.",Short story featuring everyone's favorite Wookiee

After they did discover there was like 6 pages left of the book and 3 of those she was mad at him.

That blog is focused almost entirely on the Kindle.  It includes hints on using the Kindle, articles about the Kindle, and free book offers.  I decided not to subscribe, for reasons I gave in my review for it.So, what's different about this blog?  While both blogs are oriented towards the Kindle, the focus is different.  The good news (for me) is that I Love My Kindle covers more than just the Kindle.  It also discusses the entire eReader ecosystem, including other eReaders, Publishers, etc.  The author also includes occassional ""humorous"" articles.  While I don't think that the author is a danger to those who attempt to make a living writing humor, at least he doesn't take himself seriously.  On the other hand, I haven't seen a single article about free books or other such items.  Also, it appears that the author of I Love My Kindle only publishes one article per day.All in all, while there are some things this blog does better and other things it does worse than Kindle Nation Daily, I don't think I'll be subscribing to either one of them.",A little less focused with a broader view

1278,"This book is a review of the book Surfacing by Margret Atwood, although this fact is only clearly stated in the title of the book.  This book reads like it was written as a senior  thesis college project. The main character is not named, but she is referred to as &#8220;She&#8221;, and this makes, Stopping the World, difficult to follow. Toward the end we are told the narrator (of atwoods book) is nameless. This ought to have been stated toward the beginning to eliminate  confusion. Then we are told the nameless narrator is a device to pull readers into the story:&#8220;Read as living myth, Margaret Atwood's fine novel becomes the nameless narrator's service to her community, which now includes us, the thoughtful reader.&#8221;It is difficult for readers to identify with a nameless narrator, but it is challenging for a writer to dare to do this.In this essay, a layered cake is used as the metaphor for the world and our perception of it. The icing represents our surface only existence. Only Shamans can break free to explore all the inner layers.  In the end we are encouraged to take the plunge into knowledge and awaken humanity to the fullness of existence.This book was a confusing book, (and probably also Atwood&#8217;s Surfacing book, which I did not read) which explains/applies the brilliant concepts which are clearly detailed in Joseph Campbell&#8217;s book, Hero of a Thousand Faces.

1279,"The Thinking Machine is--well--mechanical. Talk about formulaic writing! Professor Van Dusen (AKA The Thinking Machine) is an insufferable bore. The police are always too dumb to figure things out. Van Dusen recites to them (in EVERY SINGLE STORY) ""two and two make four. Not sometimes but all the time."" Ah, logic triumphs over all!If you are looking for character development, you won't find it here. The professor is unidimensional and not the least bit endearing. His dimwitted sidekick, Hatch, is always two or three steps behind. The book did have one redeeming quality--it a great help when I had a hard time falling asleep. A few pages and I would be out like a light!  And since the whole thing was summed up in the last couple of pages, you could just cut to the chase and save yourself a lot of time.If you want a good read, try Agatha Cristie (almost ANYTHING she's written), or if you like a hint of the egotistical devotee of logic, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is a better choice--hands down!",Thinking Machine Suffers Mechanical Failure

1281,"I really liked the idea of this story, but I was unable to read it to find out if there was anything to it.  It started out very choppy, completely confusing, and just plain not readable. I removed it from my Kindle a little bit into the second chapter.The story starts with a lady burning a barn with animals in it. There are names of people that you have no idea who they are, and there is a thing that I think was supposed to be a ghost, but you don't get clarification on that either. The second chapter starts with more people that you don't know, and goes into attempting to kill an unborn child. At that point I quit. I did not know who or what was happening, and quite honestly I did not care to find out.Sorry to be harsh, but this was not something that I could even pretend to like.  I don't want to read about the smell of burning cows or the poisoning of pregnant ladies.  Great idea; crappy, confusing, gross and harsh presentation.",Removed it from my Kindle after about a chapter and a half
1282,"The story was all over the place, I agree with the first reviewer, it was written in such a juvenile sense you'd think a kid just trying their hand at writing wrote this story.  It was all over the place, constant name dropping, events taking place that didn't make sense.  I'm going to attribute the author being incarcerated as a reason that certain things weren't researched, then again, the male character dropped african knowledge on the lead character so some research had to be done, but not enough to bring the story together.  There was no character or story development, I didn't understand half the drama because it came out of left field and it wasn't developed enough to make you feel any kind of way.  The premise of the story is actually pretty good and so much could have been done with it but the book needed to be completely rewritten with the premise in mind to make it a good story.  It could have been one, but this author just didn't get it done.  This book was so bad I couldn't help but continue to read it just to see how much worse it could really get.  And it outdid itself.  I would say the author needs to read different styles of writing to come into his own, learn story and character development, like I said great premise but it could have been written a whole lot better.  Winny Williams? 'Back in the days'? A month past her due date to have a 8lb baby? Going to rehab for marijuana? It's a BUNCH of other things that will make you say, huh? And scratch your head.  The author possibly has a future, but much more practice is needed, you'd be okay with this book if the author was lets say between the ages of 12-17 and just started writting just because, handed in the manuscript with little editing and turned it into book form.  It would make sense then, but this is not a good book, it had potential but the writing is NOT up to par at all.",Glad it was free

It was a nice way to communicate the story in the first third of the novel.  With that being said, this novel added nothing else new to the romance genre.  The plot was a bit predictable and the ending was (as always) wrapped up perfectly in a nice neat bow.  Not too realistic.

When attempts to get her father to sell become suspicious and underhanded Lila seeks out the head of the corporation.  Bursting into Hunter Jamison's office to demand he cease and desist, Lila was taken aback by what he demanded in exchange for her father's shop.Disfigured in a car accident Hunter Jamison felt he lost everything that mattered when he lost his looks.  He knew no woman would want to be with him if he wasn't rich and powerful, and even then his money wasn't enough for some when faced with having to look at his scarred features on a daily basis.  When Lila stormed into his office with her fiery temper and beauty to match he wanted her like he's never wanted any other woman before, and knew the only way she would want him was to proposition her using her father as leverage.Mistress to the Beast is a cute twist on the classic Beauty and the Beast fairy tale.  I really liked Lila, she's a straightforward tell it like it is type of woman.  And even though she succumbed to Hunter's wishes in order to help her father she never held her tongue when it came to telling Hunter what she thought of him.  My feelings for Hunter waffled a bit.  I loved when he showed his vulnerability, but when he wanted to be a nasty brute he did it quite well.  The chemistry and hot erotic sex scenes between these two are explosive.

1296,"My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne?  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work.  It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism.  With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook.  Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may.  The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste.  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the `science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the ""speculative"" portion to explore human nature.  Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this.  And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost.  However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well.  We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions.  The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed.  Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular ""twenty thousand leagues"" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks.  There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly.  Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base.  Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as ""inoffensive creature[s],"" he gleefully slaughters a herd of ""cruel, mischievous"" sperm whales.  Hardly sustainability at its best.  But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology.  Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design).  Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented.  Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by ""foul air.""Verne wrote at an exciting time.  The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid.  We were just beginning to understand electricity.  The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered.  Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon.  There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion.  Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given.  It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword.  I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968.  It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would).  These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel.  It also contains a ""backword"" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine.",The Original Science Fiction Classic

1298,"First of all the back description throws you off a bit and the book went in another direction I didnt expect which was a disappointment. Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war, he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation (plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he'll be an Earl due to an inheritance). So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father, he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children. They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness (Yea, I wasnt buying that). During the next few weeks, St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home. I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away (but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero's protest, at some point you need to get some back bone. Which came too late, she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away? What!? I wanted to slap her. Then the story is like a soap-opera, now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father. And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste. I skimmed alot so I cannot in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset. And I was left wondering whatever happened to the children of the duke? why bring them in the tale if you hardly mention them? The hero/heroine were likeable but not enough to save this book.",Frustrating!

It is fine to know what you want, but to try to make someone jealous by pretending to seek love or sex else where. I would have given it a better rating if the straight talk would have continued minus the manipulation. My response would have been,""If you want to have a relationship with me this is how I need it, and if and when you agree, you know where to find me"".

1302,"This is the first Star Wars novel I've read since the wonderfully adapted novelization of Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover. Sadly, Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice does not inspire me to continue reading expanded universe novels. While many readers find fault with the brief length of this novel, I found it to be the book's only saving grace (other than its price). Surprisingly, the characters in this novel are quite lackluster and are a far cry from the variety of Sith Lords we're accustomed to. Whereas the Sith Lords of the Star Wars films and previous EU books tend to be frightening figures, the 'humanized' Sith Lords in ""Precipice"" are poor ambassadors of the Dark Side of the Force.Perhaps this series will improve with successive books. But Precipice fails to deliver the kind of intriguing space opera that I love about Star Wars. Fortunately, Fate of the Jedi: Omen of which Precipice is only a prequel, appears to be a far more interesting read. As much as it pains me to say it, I would have a very difficult time recommending this book to anyone except the most die-hard Star Wars fan. Maybe John Jackson Miller will deliver the goods on the next go.",Not quite what I had expected.

It is not creatively written. He uses other writers' descriptions instead of creating his own, when there are any descriptions at all. Explanations are sketchy and characters are forgettable. Names of characters are unoriginal. There are no strong women here; Grandma sits down and cries whenever there is a difficult situation.

1313,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- Zane is in pitiful condition at the start of the story, but he&#8217;s not pitiful himself. He&#8217;s hurt and unhappy, but he doesn&#8217;t wallow in his misery. I immediately wanted someone to wrap him up in something soft and love on him.- The characters are all three likeable enough, but Randy especially is kooky. His quirkiness amused me.- I&#8217;ve read a lot of stories by this author, and the majority of them are about 80% sex. In this story, I was delighted to discover that the physical scenes didn&#8217;t start until over halfway through. That allowed for some more character development early on than is typical of Michael&#8217;s works.CONS:- Butch and Randy have been together for a while when Zane comes along. I didn&#8217;t doubt their attraction to him, nor did I doubt their willingness to invite him into their bed. But I would have liked to see a bit of conversation between the two of them before they actually do the propositioning.- I didn&#8217;t find the characters quite believable. Butch is in construction, for instance, yet he says things like this: &#8220;you&#8217;re pretty young to declare an amnesty on dating.&#8221;- Like most of this author&#8217;s works, this one could use some editing. Not just for typos; there are some errors in continuity also.Overall comments: This isn&#8217;t one of my favorites by Sean Michael, but I did like it overall. It&#8217;s very typical of the author&#8217;s style, so I can&#8217;t particularly recommend it unless you&#8217;re already a fan of his writing.","Nothing special, but I enjoyed it"

1319,"I avoided reading Mistress Christmas until I had ran out of books to read about the McKay/West family.  From the title and the synopsis, I was concerned that the leading lady would be a dominatrix, something I'm not into reading about.  Boy, I was totally wrong.Holly North fills in for a friend at a holiday themed strip club, no stripping, just walking around and talking to patrons while in the Mistress Christmas costume.  Detective Nick West is at the strip club, running his own off-duty undercover operation.  He immediately connects with Holly, and they arrange to share a night of passion.  Nick lives up to any expectation you may have about the McKay/West men as lovers, managing to be passionate, tender, and dominant, all in one night.  Holly turns out to be a bit inexperienced, and Nick is very tender and patient with her all night, it was so charming.  Of course there is a conflict that must be resolved at the end.  I really loved the relationship between the two of them.This is an excellent read, and I recommend it whether or not you are familiar with the other novels by Ms. James.  The McKay/West family is barely mentioned, so it can be a standalone story.  It is a very quick ebook, a couple hours tops.  If you would like it in print format, the bookWild West Boyscontains this story, and a story about Nick's brother called Miss Firecracker.

1322,"Hello All!  I know that I promised you this review on Saturday and I failed to deliver, but I got super busy (and by busy I mean I fell asleep on the couch)  So, without further ado, here we go.Before I get started on the quality of the book it's almost expected that I'm going to say something about the cover art.  I know I have said this before, and I'm sure by now you want to gag me with a dirty sock, but seriously...for just one second I want you to focus on the cover of ""Test Pilot's Daughter: Revenge"" and hypothesise on the writing quality.  Not so great right? With a less than appealing (and I might add horribly cheesy cover) the first assumption a reader is going to make is on the quality of the book itself.  Luckily this book was sent to me by the author, so the cover art was not a factor in the actual purchase of the book, BUT... it is never to late to express the importance of a well put together binding.Now, on to the more important details...the book as a whole.""Steve Ward"" is a visual genius when it comes to the focus of flight, but it does not save him from an excruciatingly slow start.  I was almost lost on this book when, 40% of the way in, the promised ""intriguing"" plot had yet to emerge.  Character development and set up are very important to a novel, but sometimes enough is enough.  When an author decides to write a suspense novel it is important to quickly capture the audience, and then weave the building details amongst the main storyline. Now, that is not to say that the suspense was lacking in anyway once it actually got started.Christine is hard as nails, and more determined than a thirsty man looking for water.  Her focus is to get to NASA, but when a girlfriend agrees to marry, a less than sparkly clean psych professor, her focus makes a direct left.  Less career path, more staying alive.  What was supposed to be a happy little treasure hunt in the islands suddenly turns into the fight of a lifetime, including drug runners and an approaching hurricane.  Can Christine make it out alive? Can her friends? And what exactly happened to their pilot?I was afraid at first that ""Ward's"" attention to (each and every detail) in the craft of flying would drag the flow down, but quickly realized that even though the book boasted pages of in-flight detail, the way in which it was written gave me the most crystal clear picture of ""How To Fly A Plane"" I had ever gotten from a book. (I'm pretty sure I could even pull it off at this point.) I also (regrettably so) disliked all of the characters in the first several chapters, but quickly came to admire them for the vast differences, and in the end the suspense and twists won me over.I do think that ""Ward"" has some improvements to make in the future if he intends to make a solid name for himself in the literary world, but those ""changes"" are by no means unattainable. 1.  Pay attention to your presentation.  2. Get to the good stuff a little quicker.  I will go on record though as saying I genuinely enjoyed this novel, and if you are looking for a quick suspense fix ""Test Pilot's Daughter: Revenge"" is more than worth the .99 cents.There were plane crashes, evil stepfathers, shallow graves, dog fights, fake diamonds, buried treasure, a 15 year old boy that would make any Boy Scout leader proud, and the most creative revenge plot I have read in quite some time.Happy reading my fellow Pilots and remember: always leave your hotel number with a loved one.",Reviewed by Kindleobsessed

1346,"This book was inspired by the true story of Alexander Selkirk, who survived alone for almost five years on an uninhabited island off the coast of Chile.It is a very interesting story with a lot of imagination by Verne as it is written in the later 1800s. It starts in 1865, March, Richmond, VA. The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a ""everyman"" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist. It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available. They do an excellent job using what is at hand, and make chemicals including nitroglycerine, using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale. Hard to always appreciate that it was written in 1870, as it has aged well.  An enjoyable Verne adventure novel, certainly one of his best.",An excellent adventure novel from 1870

1352,"All to the stories in this volume are really good. Starting with the Red Thumb Mark, then John Thorndyke's Cases, The Eye of Osiris and the Mystery of 31 New Inn.  Dr. Thorndyke's Cases consisted of 8 separate cases, The Man with the Nailed Shoes, The Stranger's Latchkey, The Anthropologist at Large, The Blue Sequin, The Moabite Cipher, The Mandarin's Pear, The Aluminum Dagger, and The Message from the Deep Sea.In each of these stories the reader is treated to Dr. Thorndyke's extreme powers of observation, his ability to use the relevant facts and clues to the mysteries and incidents, his remarkable use of the science and technology of his day to resolve known issues and clues, his lack of assumptions when given red herrings and false leads as well as his ability to be his own investigator.The reader also is presented with the same details as Dr. Thorndyke, but the reader too is given a face saving out if they don't come to the same conclusions as Dr. Thorndyke, because Dr. Jervis, Thorndyke's partner and foil, never seems to get it either and like the reader doesn't always have Thorndyke's extreme and diversified knowledge at their fingertips or memory cells.All in all I look forward to reading all of R. Austin Freeman's books, even though he does seem to go on on with some of his discussions, which sometimes aren't needed for the story, and is somewhat recondite with his writings - I have used my Kindle's dictionary feature quite extensively.These stories are also very informative in teaching the reader what the prevalent scientific knowledge and technologies were, relative to their applications to CSI as fostered by Freeman, in the very early 1900's (1907, 1907, 1911, & 1912).I really think some enterprising movie or TV director/producer ought to take these stories and develop them into a good series.  Not enough people are familiar with R. Austin Freeman's books, I certainly wasn't and I have been reading who done it's and other mysteries of and on for about 60 years, starting with the Hardy Boys.",Move over Sherlock - make room for Dr. Thorndyke

He was going to make this decision, but he didn't even really consult Sarah. While he is gone, he sounds off over the limited communication time he has to another woman. He comes back and expects her to fall into his arms in a very, ""where's my supper, wench,"" sort of way. He gets jealous, but doesn't understand that she might be have feelings, too, like, say, jealousy over the other woman he has talked to more than he talked to her. Disregards her in decision-making, controlling, displays a complete lack of understanding of her feelings...hmm, still not spelling ""good husband material"" to me.Warning lights are flashing everywhere for me, but, as usual for paranormal fiction, the ""destined mate"" card trumps all, so we are supposed to buy their HEA?

But being neighbors brought them together often in fun, mutual problem solving, and love.  I recognized many of the relationships and family situations in this story as having occurred in my own life.  This author's depth of understanding of these relationships and situations and the resolutions to the problems that crop up in families is astounding.  I find myself nodding my head as I read her stories, smiling at some of the scenes in the story, and feeling sad with some of the others...but always feeling as if I know the characters myself, intimately.

1358,"Private Property by Leah Braemel is the first book in the Hauberk Security series. It is also Leah's first published work and I enjoyed it so much I knew I'd read anything future she published. The characters are interesting, the dialog engaging, and the sex scenes are hot. What truly enamored me though was the fact that this book takes place less than a half of a mile from my home and she described it perfectly.This book centers around Mark Rodgriguez and Jodi Tyler. Mark is the owner of Celeda Security located in Texas and Jodi one of his operatives. The book opens with Jodi staking out a home she is suppose to break into to prove to the owner that his current security company isn't any good and they should hire Mark's company. Jodi is upset that Mark chose her to head up this security breach since it's her birthday and she'd rather spend the evening with him. She begins to think that perhaps this is Mark's way of breaking off their ""no strings"" relationship. What we soon find out is that Mark has set up an evening with his old college roommate and friend, Sam Watson, (owner of Hauberk Security) to help him fulfill some of Jodi's fantasies as a birthday gift. The tables are turned on Mark and he soon realizes that he has been an idiot when it comes to Jodi.This is a very good book, Mark is a likeable albeit at times kind of clueless hero. He thinks he has his relationship with Jodi all figured out but in reality he doesn't. It takes Sam, some restraints, and some interesting situations to make him see things differently.Jodi is capable, extremely likeable, but very insecure. She's dated some losers in the past that have made it difficult to trust and thus she's always waiting for Mark to dump her. She's feeling guilty because she agreed to an unemotional affair with Mark but she's fallen in love with him.I like both Mark and Jodi, but Sam is the one that stole the show in this book. From the minute he came on the scene I was hooked and knew that I had to know more about this complex man. Considering all the ""fun"" things he has in his home, you just know there is a great story behind him.For a first book, Private Property is very good but it left me wanting more. While the story is complete, I knew that I'd have to read the next one as soon as it was available. I always love when I find a writer that I ""mesh"" with right away and Leah is one of those authors. I'm very happy to give this first effort a solid 4 stars.***NOTE*** As I was reading I felt myself wanting to know more about Mark and Jodi and was pleased when I got to the end and found there was a free read (First Night) detailing the beginning of Mark and Jodi's relationship. It answered a lot of questions and helped me understand the characters so much more. You can find this at Leah's website.",Recommended Read

It was very disconcerting to be reading and all of a sudden, the chapter would end without finishing the thought or the sentence; sometimes even the word wasn't finished.

Its a great progression of events with a serious plot twist in the end which I won't ruin of course!

1365,"The back story of each character keeps everyone involved and the manipulation of the characters is great. As each character develops and you learn their stories, you feel connected. The technical aspects aren't overdone to blow away the average reader and the science is fun.

I wish it had, but it just kind of ends.","Oddly satisfying, but not great"

On top of that (and this from someone who asked for all the Jackie Collins ""Lucky"" books for Christmas one year), the writing is absolute garbage. Just awful. I can't believe it's the same writer, in fact. Perhaps Collins turned it over to someone else? I would hope so, because this is really impoverished writing.","Not a ""story"", just a teaser"

1369,"For close to five years now Saul Hunter has left his home every Friday evening telling his mate Ryce Hunter that he was going out to get laid.  Saul doesn't return home until Saturday morning, exhausted and quiet.Ryce decides to go out to a bar himself after Saul leaves once again on a Friday night.  If Saul can do it then so can Ryce.  What Ryce doesn't expect to find is that he has a Tri Omega mate too when he spots Carrington `Cary' Jones.With a special mate like Cary however, there are possible problems.  Ryce has no trouble permanently claiming Cary but Saul must claim him as well for a true tri-mating to occur.  Ryce and Saul already have big problems so adding Cary to the mix might spell disaster for an already teetering mating.  What if Saul refuses to claim Cary?  What that would mean for the three of them is unthinkable.Sexy wolves and carnal lovemaking gives readers exactly what they are looking for in Stolen Desires.  This is the fourth story in the Tri Omega Mates series and can be read as a stand alone tale.  The romance between Ryce and Cary is tender when needed and rough when necessary.  Also, the emotional turmoil Saul experiences is felt in Stolen Desires.  I think that editing out a bit  of the way through would have kept the suspense and secret more interesting.  It takes too long to find out Saul's big secret which takes away from an otherwise very enjoyable tale.  Having said that, fans of the series won't be disappointed and new readers are certain to find Stolen Desires very entertaining!LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Stolen Desires

1373,"I decided to read this book because of the description.  The premise was compelling.This book was very slow in many parts.  I felt the author suggested many previously published stories such as THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL, THE DAVINCI CODE and APOLLO 13.  I was often disturbed by the back and forth of the story going from one group of characters to another.  I also didn't like how some characters were introduced toward the end of the book with no back story.  Also some characters throughout the book were left without closure at the end.What I did like in this book was how good the author was at making me want to find out what would happen next. His suspense and action scenes were very well done. I read this book straight through even though I needed to skim many of the slow parts.  This book read like an unedited first draft and would have been a prime candidate for a rewrite.  This author shows promise but needs to tighten this plot.

Just a year before while vacationing in Mexico she put on a wish bracelet (along with a couple of her friends) and wished for the one thing she'd wanted for years. Though Mariah writes off the whole thing as fantasy, she knows she must wear the bracelet until it comes off on its own. She forgets about the whole thing until it does fall off and she meets a wish fairy who swears Mariah will get what she wanted. It takes a little convincing, but she begins to believe when the man she wished for suddenly comes back into her life. The only problem is she is limited to forty-eight hours before the wish expires and there are some catches the fairy initially fails to mention that could ruin everything. Now that Mariah is finding love, she has to get her happily ever after and will do whatever it takes to make all her dreams come true.I admit I didn't expect much from this short novel. It sounded like something I probably wouldn't even be able to finish. Yet once I started reading, the story really grabbed my attention. Mariah is a strong and independent woman, but she isn't afraid to dream and take chances. She has a sweet and soft side that helps you relate to her. When Tucker shows up, you root for her to find the love she wants with him. I will warn he isn't quite as easy to relate to in the beginning. This could be due to the fact I am not much of a poker fan and this guy made a living as a professional poker player. Definitely not my kind of dream guy. Yet I hung in there for Mariah's sake and eventually found myself really liking Tucker as more of his background came out. Despite it being a short novel, you get enough details to help you understand the two main characters and feel like you know them fairly well by the end. Even some of the side characters were great and helped flesh the story out.There are a couple other things that could be considered both strengths and weaknesses for the novel. One, there are a lot of sex scenes and they begin early on in the story. I had hoped to get a little more warmed up to the characters first and that threw me off a bit. On the other hand, you learn a lot by what they are thinking and saying during those scenes. Tucker and Mariah met many years before so there is a lot of reminiscing even as they jump back in the sack together. Also, the author does an excellent job of writing sizzling scenes that most any romance reader could appreciate. I wish the story had been longer and more drawn out (there was a lot of room for growth) but I also understand writers like to tell the story as they see it. You don't have to deal with all the misunderstandings that are often used as ploys to prevent the H/h from finding their Happily Ever After (HEA) more quickly. It was refreshing to see the two characters forthright and upfront about their feelings without all the holding back you often see.There were a couple of instances where the dialog seemed a bit weird to me, but most of the time I had no problem with it. The ending was the best part. It tied everything up and even provided for some comedy (I won't say how, you'll just have to read it). All in all, this was a novel I don't regret trying and believe it is one most romance readers will enjoy. It looks like this is the first in a series so I plan to check out the ones that follow ""All In"". I have faith they will be at least as good as this one.",A compelling contemporary romance with a spark of the paranormal

1394,"Overall I enjoyed this story.Declan is down on his luck and desperate times call for desperate measures. Not sure of where his next meal is coming from and without a home, he takes a job at the Chicken Ranch working as a prostitute. ""Pride didn't make him any less homeless or fill the empty ache of a stomach that had gone too long without sustenance.""Killian is an accountant with a steady job and home. But he his lacking something in his life and a one-off, spur of the moment visit leads him to Declan.I like the way both characters are portrayed, particularly Declan. I felt very sympathetic towards his situation.Declan is proud and doesn't accept his situation. He looks for ways to give himself the life he desires including taking classes to gain qualifications. But he struggles to come to terms with the life he has made at the Chicken Ranch and doesn't feel worthy of Killian. He is waiting for something bad to happen. ""If his own father couldn't love him, what hope did he have of finding someone who could?""When things don't go smoothly, Declan almost believes this is what he deserves. ""The bad thing was, he wasn't even sure he had a right to be mad. After all, he was a whore.""It was a big plus that even though Declan works at the Chicken Ranch, this book didn't spend too much time focusing on happenings at the brothel. It was more focused on the development of the romantic relationship between the two men.I loved the slow and steady approach Killian took to their physical relationship and how much Declan appreciated sex with Killian. Even though he worked in the sex trade, simple kisses with Killian had Declan waiting in anticipation. ""Thankfully, he found the prospect of being with Killian completely different than work. The act was the same, but the purpose behind it was not."" and ""This wasn't just about sex. The actions were similar, but the level of intimacy was as diverse as night from day.""My only actual dislike with this story was the use of a couple of words which I personally find a bit of a turn-off: ""....Grave's tool."" ""Killian's meat.""This book was provided by the author in return for an honest review.",A really enjoyable story
1395,"The life of a fifty-five year-old Master gardener may not sound very exciting, but for Demetria, gardener and Master Magician in the Kingdom of Sage, it's anything but dull. With the Rat Kingdom threatening the western border, and the snakes of the Slithering Kingdom coming in from the south, Sage has its share of troubles. And since Demetria is the first line of her kingdom's defense, she keeps very busy.Sage: Tales from a Magic Kingdom, is a collection of three novellas, each containing a well-plotted, magical adventure. Using only a few thousand words, the author creates a unique world peopled with interesting characters. There is a sense of adventure in every story as Demetria uses her plant magic to rescue her family as well as her kingdom. It's also a pleasant change to read about a heroine who defies stereotypes. Demetria may be grandmotherly and sweet, but she is a courageous combatant nonetheless.This is a fun read, suitable for readers of all ages. I definitely recommend Sage: Tales from a Magical Kingdom.This review was originally published on my blog, Cheap Thrills - [...]",Unique Heroine

1400,"I bought this at the Samhain website (had a coupon from the RWA conference) and was extremely impressed. This was my first reading of this author and I thought she did a fantastic job for a short story. In fact I was just up here on Amazon looking for something else of hers to read and saw that this book has only a 3 star rating... shocked me into writing my own review!The other reviews have done a good job of recounting the plot here, so I'll just say that I think the story was very well written, dark and steamy with a nicely executed HEA. It stumbled a little bit at the black moment, but not enough to throw me off.If the story sounds intriguing to you, give it a shot. She's a wonderful writer.",Excellent!
1401,"I have not finished this book yet.  Yes, I am almost finished but after reading the crazy ass chapters about Sylvia and Michael - I had to review now.  I was planning on giving a 5 star review but after reading the ""sex chapters"" as I have come to call them. Definitely a 3 star ranking now.What started off as a promising story and thrilling mystery, soon became Bruce Wayne/Alfred with a lot of kinky sex thrown in. What the hell were you thinking Mr. Walker??  I thought, at first, this book was going to be similar to The Troupe (which was FANTASTIC) but after ""scene 95-97"", I was laughing. The story became so childish and moronic in the writing and the name change????

1407,"Actually I purchased this by mistake. I was looking at novels by Murakami Haruki and this one was in the ""other books"" section. All of the Murakami books are not available on Kindle for me in my area (Asia) which was disappointing. This one was, and as I thought it was Murakami (a fantastic Japanese contemporary author, by the way) I snapped it up. It was only when I was almost at the checkout that I realized the author was not Murakami. But I went forward and purchaed it anyway, to see what it was like, and also because I needed another book for my commuting to and from work.This book had an interesting concept, and the way it was written was interesting. I didn't really like the whiney main character but the fact that the author could evoke ""dislike for a character"" in me makes for good writing.The message in the story was good, and I subscribe to it whole heartedly.The ending was flat, as if the author ran out of time and just whipped out something to get the book in under the wire. I think it could have ended differently, and been a much better book.I'm glad I downloaded this book because it saved me a few dollars from a hard copy, and for three stars, the paperback price would have caused me to downgrade to two stars.","Interesting, Good Message, Flat Ending"

I'd recommend it to my friends and let them make their own judgement on it.",Strange but ok
1415,"The previous book I read by Mari Carr - ""Covert Lessons"", published by Ellora's Cave - was terrible, so I didn't go into this one with very high expectations. However, this book was put out by a different publisher and therefore had a different editor. I found this book to be a great improvement over ""Covert Lessons"".Gwen Preston has written a popular book of sex-themed short stories called Evening Songs. One of the stories, The Darkest Night, contained scenes of BDSM and Gwen, ashamed of her real-life interest in BDSM because (in part) of a previous relationship that went bad, used a pen name for that story.Ty Ransome is a Hollywood action star who wants to turn over a new leaf and do ""serious"" films. He has read Evening Songs and thinks the book would make a good basis for a movie. He has also discovered that Gwen was the true author of *all* of the stories in the book. This intrigues him because he is secretly a sexual dominant. He offers to purchase the movie rights to the stories with the requirement that Gwen help him write the screenplay.Gwen comes to Hollywood, and Ty puts her up in his guest house. He begins to visit her late every night, after she is in bed, and they talk for hours. Ty makes it clear that he is interested in her in more than a platonic way. Gwen initially keeps him at bay, but he eventually convinces her that he is sincere and also that they should reenact the scenes in her short stories as a way to help them develop the screenplay. Gwen agrees. During the course of this reenactment, Gwen and Ty discover each others secrets - that she is a submissive who craves (some) pain with sex and that he is a dominant who enjoys dishing out what she needs.I liked the chemistry between the main characters and the fact that the relationship didn't start out with sex right away. I do wish that we had gotten to experience a little more of that initial phase of the relationship rather than simply being told that it happened. I also liked that Gwen has a spine. She doesn't immediately cave to Ty's desires, and she's got a few good zippy comebacks for him. Ty is good hero; he is patient when Gwen seems to need it and later forceful in way that doesn't make him seem like an ass.However, this book still suffers from some of the same basic writing problems as ""Covert Lessons"" - avoiding ""said"" as a dialogue tag (my biggest pet peeve); characters inferring the thoughts of other characters and telling the readers that, rather than the author *showing* the reader, occasional bits of stilted dialogue. The flaws are not as prevalent, though, so I don't know if it's result of the different editor, or if the author is improving her craft on her own.I might try another of Ms. Carr's books if the plot sounded interesting and as long as it wasn't from EC.",Better than thought it would be
1416,"This novella had a fairly interesting premise, but the heroine spent too much time acting like a spoiled willful child, which, to be fair, she was. Too often, though, I would have been happy to slap some sense into her. There could have been some redemption for the story at the end, but the author clearly does not believe in happily ever after. It was extremely disappointing and downright depressing to me. Don't bother with this one.",No HEA here

She overcomes tradition and the growing threat of Speica. This novel has history, knights, and mythological creatures and is filled with intrigue, mystery, horror, and, most important of all, love.

1429,"When I was 13 and haunting the public library one summer, I discovered Zane Grey western novels. The very first one I read was East of the Pecos, and it thrilled me. It had action and adventure, horses which I loved, and told of an Old West where men were men and women were glad of it. The novels had a strong romance subplot -- at least strong according to my newly-minted teen-hood.That one book had me scouring the section where his books were shelved. I can't remember how many I read. Each thrilled me as much as that first one.When I bought my Kindle a couple of years ago, I spent days scrolling through the lists of free books and low-priced ebooks. Imagine my delight when I came across this little gem -- a collection of 26 of Zane Grey's most popular novels and with a Linked Table of Contents. I grabbed it, and started reading.I have to admit that I was totally surprised that the stories still captivated me. I'd thought I might find them as stale as an episode of Gunsmoke on TV Land. Not at all. The stories are still compelling plus I love the American West history in each.After I'd read the first book in this collection, I visited the Texas Ranger Museum in Waco, Texas. Walking through the museum, I realized how accurate were Grey's portrayals of the men who brought law to Texas and to the history of nineteenth century America.This collection is wonderful, and it's worth far more than the modest price. The books are delightful in every way and make one understand why the western was so popular in television and movies for so long.",Classic Westerns Hold Up
1430,"I knew that this was a multiple partner story before I read it.  I picked it up intentionally to see if buying the first book would be worthwhile.  I have decided against it.  There were just too many creep factors for me, personally, to become that involved in the characters or even to find the love scenes all that erotic (in fact, I found them very bland).  The creep factors were:1. The three men are brothers, which I hadn't expected to be that bothered by but once I started reading I didn't find it intriguing at all or believable.2.  The female protagonist systemically ""corners"" each brother and practically begs for sex from each man in turn.  Just not sexy or romantic.3.  She's 8 months pregnant at the time.4.  They all call the child ""theirs""...he is ""their son""...as in they do not know who fathered the baby and so all claim him. Something about this went against my own peace of mind.  Maybe too...cult-like?  Takes me to number 5...5.  The entire scenario is so unrealistic that even for a book I couldn't suspend my disbelief.  The author writes the 4-way relationship as a pleasant, laid back one, with no jealousy issues or the woman just throwing her hands up and saying ""I need space, quit touching me for one freaking minute"".  All is perfect in their world, nobody minds sharing and they all know each other's business.  And sure, the heroine is well cared and the men genuinely love her, but at the same time she is overly cossetted.  It left me feeling like she had no real freedom, always surrounded by men hovering over her.  She didn't have enough of an independent spirit for the heroines I usually like reading about.  Oh, and the birth scene was poorly written and also not realistic at all.Some people will like and have liked this story just fine and are not bothered by any of the things that bothered me.

But he was able to help his Mum with his Dad, who was very ill, when it was necessary.

The police weren't too impressed with Jim, in fact he was a suspect for a time, but when they discovered a killer was stalking, sending warning emails, then killing Jim's old female classmates, they worked together, finding the remaining women, and putting them under police protection.The killer was too clever though, as those protected still died, so Jim and Buck upped the ante, putting their own lives in danger.

1439,"This was a cool little story.  It was engaging, interesting, and pretty original.  But I also found it seriously lacking an authentic voice.  Meaning that the author writes the story as a narration alternating between all of the characters, the main characters being two ten-year-olds, and one five-year-old, and the thought process of all three are just not believable.  I thought many times as I was reading that it seemed more like an adult reminiscing about his childhood, and projecting logic and maturity onto the characters that would simply not be possible at their ages.  I was also pretty disappointed with the ending, as the author seems to just get bored with the story, and ends it without much care.  Overall it was a fun, quick read, but I'm very glad I got it for free.",A curious mix of engaging and boring..

1444,"So this is totally over the top &#34;beef cake&#34; erotica.  Yes , I did finish it.  Yes, I think the author has done a pretty good job.  I did skim arts of it, however.  We meet a beautiful young woman that is saved by a caring older man via a platonic marriage. The opening scene is this h enjoying a dip in a river while unbeknownst to her, Devon, our H, is watching her lustfully from the trees.  The H is the son of her husband.  He was raised by his aunts after his mother died and the Father felt  unprepared to raise him by himself. Devon is later kidnapped and raised by a band of lawless men.  Devon is tough, dominant and ...yes...gorgeous .....and huge...in every way.....hence.....the cannon references.  As the story opens, Devon is on his way to see the Father he does not remember because he has been sent a message that the old man is dying.Devon,totally hot.  I dug his alpha ways and the sex scenes in which he is totally dom like.  I did feel sorry for the secondary male in the story, the doctor. There are some threesome scenes and the doc is more or less a foil to show how dom-like Devon is to the whole dynamic.I must admit, I read this book several weeks ago and cannot remember the heroine's name. Forgive me.  This is a long book. I paid a dollar for it and it is worth it.  The author attempts to make this more than just erotica by giving us a bigger story in which we follow the Hero on his trail ride to hunt and kill some fathomless bad guys.  This part I skimmed.  But  this is a sexy, erotic read if this is what you want.  Do not expect a deep introspective or thought provoking read.  But like choosing food from a menu, sometimes a light spicy snack is just what you need  and not a protein filled entr&eacute;e.",Cannon....never heard it called that.  Lol

1447,"Having enjoyed my way through all of his major works, I am now filling in the remaining gaps in my reading of FP Wilson.  This one, ""Virgin"", was originally published in 1996 under the pseudonym, Mary Elizabeth Murphy. I have no clue why he used a nom de plume, except possibly that it is rather different from everything else that he had written to date.  Not horror, not SF, but your basic religious fantasy.  The eponymous Virgin is, indeed, Mary, the mother of Jesus, the one straight out of the standard Christian theology.This is nothing like Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code or any of his other novels.  Although the characters move around a lot, it's not anything like a treasure hunt, or, at least after the early sections of the novel, a mystery to be solved.  It's worth pointing out that it was published long before Brown sold millions of copies books dealing with supposed hidden truths of the Catholic Church. Anyway, the premise is interesting (as it is with all FP Wilson writings that I have seen), and to my knowledge is one of the first mainstream ""what if it were true"" novels dealing with the iconography of ChristianityAlthough published well after many of his blockbuster novels that made FPW a household name (at least among horror aficionados, Virgin has the feel of an ""early"" novel.  I'm not sure how to describe it more specifically than that.  It just didn't feel as solid as most of FPW's other works.  The characters of Father Dan and Sister Carrie are well enough developed FPW's usually are), and their early relationship is is believable.  Later developments between the two, well, less so.  Supporting characters were also three-dimensional with interesting backstories, particularly the mysterious Israeli agent who seems to have a special agenda with respect to the relic.For me the biggest disappointment in this novel was the ending.  After a more than reasonable build-up, the last 20% of the novel, especially the literal deus ex machina ending just left me feeling cheated.  As if FPW had jumped the proverbial (pun intended) shark.  I just didn't find the sequence of events believable or compelling or even logical (if anything based in religious mythology can be said to be logical).  The ending felt rushed, and cheap compared to the set-up, and to the endings to the dozens of other FP Wilson novels that I've read.Perhaps it's in part because I'm not a ""true believer"", and have always had trouble understanding how so many so easily accept the whole Christian mythos when it seems so full of logical flaws and impossibilities.  Anyway, this one didn't do it for me.  It was OK, but not nearly in the same league as the Repairman Jack or Adversary Cycle series, or many of his other parts of the Secret History of the World (e.g., Black Wind, published in 1988, being a prime example of FP Wilson at his best.)J.M.

It was so good I didn't want to stop.The writing, formatting, editing, etc. were terrific and what I have come to expect from Mr. Konrath's novels.The action was tightly written with no extraneous detail.Terrific from beginning to end.The Bad Stuff:None that I can think of.This isn't really a criticism, but I would have liked to have more background on Taylor and Donaldson (I'm bad with names, hope I got those right.).  I always like to know the 'why' behind a serial killer. But, that's just my personal preference. It definitely did not affect my enjoyment of this gruesome story.Overall:If you liked Serial at all, you will love this even more. It's not quite as gory, but there's a time and a place for everything. This novella hits the bull's eye for action/suspense fans who like a little blood and gore on the side.",Liked Serial?
1450,"The premise of this book was stereotypes.  I get that.  I did not get why everyone played up to their stereotype, would not compromise, or listen to the other side. Everyone was hurt by the opposite sex at some point in their life, and just decided the other sex was worthless?  Come on, what a bunch of quitters.  Stanna is just dumb.  She lets Ian lead her around by the nose, and then spills company info to him after he is fired.  She evidently has no remorse about doing that. Why not stop griping and get a new job?  Oh yeah, the hot boss.  Jake's story was so silly, it was unbelievable. His reaction to Stanna's big discovery?  Wow, she's not manipulative after all.  Bah! Then at the end, they come up with a compromise that solved the whole problem with no sweat.  One that made sense from the get-go. Oh yeah, that no compromise through most of the book thing again.

She owned a bar he frequented called the Diamond, but she never got any farther than flirting with him for the last two years, and she was tired of it.  Sam was losing everything that had meant anything to her, and before she left the Chicago area, she was going to take one good memory with her to her new life in New York, and that was a night with Riley.Riley had wanted the Diamond ever since being forced to retire from baseball, but was having pangs of conscience about how underhanded he had been to get it.  He went to his friend who was also Sam's financial manager, and asked him not to extend her loan.  He was in essence forcing the only friend he had ever had to give up what meant the most to her.  When she saw him that evening, he was shocked when Sam suggested they hit the sheets before she left town.  He had wanted her for years, and there was no way he could say no, but wondered what the fallout would be when she found out he was the reason for her being ruined.This story had a lot of action and steamy lovin.

1455,"First book in Wicked  series, followed byWicked Bad: Wicked, Book 2.Plot:Young female Magians (witches) are being killed. For some reason the only person who can help is ""human"" Callie. She has to go undercover, with two beaus, to smoke out the murderer. Only Tucker and Tyghe are not exactly uninterested in Callie, Callie isn't exactly un-magical and the Bad Guy is not someone anyone would have expected.Comments:- A short book (1488 kindle locations) but a complete story. Although it is the first in a series, the plot was completed, no hanging plot-threads as such.- The end of this book comes upon us very quickly. All this build up to find the murderer and *bam* it's over. Very disappointing. Yes, I like how it all came out, I like the HEA, I like who Callie becomes, but for all the long-winded clothes shopping and angst over placing Callie in such danger, the lack of action/danger/suspense is seriously disappointing- Sex is m/f (with possibility of being caught) and m/f/m. There are handcuffs and ""rough"" play (but no violence). The goal is a committed m/f/m relationship, and the males are brothers so no m/m. The sex is HOT and (mostly) loving. The three are forced together by fate/destiny so with that we get the ""is this really who we want/what we want"" angst. It makes the sex at times ""unwanted"", ""I'm only here, I only lust for you, because we have no choice"". A bit primal and feral. In the end, they come together with love as well as desire (how else do they get their HEA?) but it takes a few practice runs.- Callie should be an amazingly strong, interesting character. Instead she seems to have her fabulous traits ignored. Annoying.Opinion:So much possibility. What a shame it couldn't be seen through to the end. Loved the beginning. Loved the idea of loving Tucker and distant Tyghe being part of the Triune. Hated the reason Callie was left in an (apparently) abusive home, that Tyghe who treated her as a nothing her whole life was ""forgiven"", that presumably Moira knew all of this and did nothing, that this ""human"" was the only one to go undercover (if it had been Tucker's idea, as a cop, okay, but it wasn't), that Mitchell was pretty much ignored. Maybe there is more in the later books, but it does not appear so. If this is the sum and total of Callie's story I am very disappointed. After finishing this book I don't remember the wicked sex, the loving bonds, the exciting finale; I remember a character I wanted to know more about, who's story was half told. Definitely could have been better.",A Wicked Witchy Menage

1457,Hot sex scenes and good chemistry between the two.  Wish they had had more time to build a relationship or go on a date or two.

1458,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""once upon a time."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. The dialogues, however, are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase, and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.",A Great Collection of Fairy Tales

1460,"I found Blind Malice to be an enjoyable read on many levels, especially for a debut. Being from NC myself, I enjoyed the setting very much and found it true to place. The visual descriptions and writing style are very, very good. The mystery falls into the cozy mystery style and is well thought out and plotted. The descriptions of flora and fauna are truly outstanding. Made this non-gardener want to go plant something.All that said, I did feel that Rachel and other characters could have been better developed. Personally, I probably would've enjoyed the book much more if I had gotten to know Rachel better. Hopefully, in future books of the series Rachel will be more fully developed and become more personable.I also wish the book had been longer. It reads more like a novella, which is fine, as it suited my mood at the time, but I think it should probably be labelled as novella rather than a novel. For me, a little more depth and length is required to truly merit the label novel and this lack of depth is what caused any disappointment I felt in the book.I liked Blind Malice enough,though, that I will certainly read more installments in the series and can recommend this first one to anyone who loves plants, flowers and gardening.

Unfortunately, from the beginning I felt like this was the 2nd or 3rd book of a series. The background is sort of filled in eventually, but it takes almost the entire book to do so, including the 'bonus story.'While I do love the characters Count and Kara, everything else about the book was difficult to follow and enjoy. The flow of the plot was not smoothe. The other characters seemed unfinished. I don't normally mind being thrown in the middle of a setting with gradual background information released as I read, but the author did a poor job of intergrating the reader into his world at a good pace. The beginning was very busy and had a lot going on, only as a recap in his hospital stay, and THEN the reader is put into the present time, which is slow moving. The bonus story felt like another ""how I met this other character"" mini story that was put in at random fillers during the plot.Count and Kara are good characters. The others need more polish. The book as a whole seemed completely unorganized. The idea for this magical world and its characters is great, but it's poorly executed.","Lacking a lot, but great idea overall..."

You can't go wrong by adding this book to your library!,I loved this book!!
1493,"Another hot story. Once again it centers more on dom than sex. I like more sex in mine. There are a lot of sexual things that lead up to the sex however which makes it hot. And once again she uses her size 18 female and the girl on the cover is no way a size 18. Good story, but I find I did not like the way she portraits the females reactions in both this one and A Spanking for Valentine. She made them a little too child like in some of their reactions. Anyway still good if you want a quick hot book.",Kidnapped for Christmas
1494,"Josh worshiped the ground Peter walked on, the air he breathed in and was always amazed at the pastry masterpieces the chef could create. Josh was always honored when Peter asked him to assist in pastry competitions. So when Peter asks Josh back to his place after an event Josh jumps at the offer to go see where the man lives.Peter is a confident chef who knows he is good. Josh on the other hand thinks himself inferior to Peter until Peter tells and shows him otherwise. Peanut Butter Kisses is an excellent read; great storyline, great foreplay and a wonderful finale.

1496,"When I first came across Jonny Tangerine's Toe Popper I hesitated reading it because of the cover. I just kept visualizing this lady on the cover getting blown up. I think if the cover had just shown the water and sand etc. with no people on the cover I may have felt different and bought it. JMO. My family and friends and I had a discussion on covers and if any of us had not bought a book because of the cover and some of us said "" A picture is worth a thousand words"" and it is the first thing we see when seeing a book is it's cover and it gives an impression of what the book is about. I've come across 3 Kindle story covers that I hadn't bought until I asked my family and friends if any of them have read the story's.I read this story week's ago and am just getting time to write the review. This mystery was gifted to me by a friend who thought I would like it and I am glad that he did because I thoroughly got hooked with the many twists and turns and holding my breath at certain times in this mystery.Characters FBI agent Catherine (I was thrilled to see a strong female FBI lead character) and to know the background and turmoil that Major Joel Lane was going through. These two characters were striving to find out who the culprit was and to put a stop to this madness.I am looking forward to reading more from Jonny Tangerine and I hope there will be a book #2 to this novel.I recommendToe Popperto mystery/thriller readers.",4 1/2 STARS for Toe Popper !!

1497,Stephanie Bond is an excellent author for those of us that enjoy Romantic Comedy!  I have added her to my  list of favorite authors.  Her books are delightfully humorous and I hope she continues to tickle our funny bones for years to come.,I am reading this now and find it delightful.
1498,"I wish Draven had written the story in third person, but I understood her intentions when I read the author's note.This was a good, fast read for entertainment. It didn't boil my blood or anything but was still entertaining. I'm satisfied but not lusting for more.",Okay...
1499,"I enjoyed the basic storyline, and the characters were decently fleshed out, but the editing errors made it difficult to truly enjoy the story.  Sentences seeming to end without completing the thought.  Supporting characters whose names seems to change midstory, and then back again.  Many basic grammar errors.  While I realize that some of these e-books are published as a work in progress, completed sentences and continuous character names throughout don't seem like too much to ask for.  Hoping the author will take a second stab at cleaning it up so it might actually be worth paying $.99 for.","OK story, Needs Editing!"

1501,"I had high hopes for this book, since I loved her other books. This one sadly, didn't cut it for me. It fell a bit short. The characters are well developed, but the plot is a bit too simple. The interaction between the characters didn't work for me. Tucker has a thing for Micah (vice versa), sleeps with Micah, leaves Micah, Micahs still holds a flame for Tucker, Micah goes to Tucker for help, Tucker is a selfish ass, Tucker still wants Micah, etc. I still strongly recommend her other books, just not this one.",Wasn't that big of a fan of this particular story
1502,"Before I begin, this is the second book of a series - if you haven't read Book 1, you need to readRight Ascension (Edge of Apocalypse).  Otherwise, you'll be saying ""huh?"" throughout the story.I judge my science fiction on a modified version of the Baen criteria: the scientific advances / future technology needs to be somewhat believable, if there are aliens they need to be presented in some realistic format with names I can pronounce in my head while I read, and must have some type of plot with circumstances - good or bad - with their resolution I can get my head around, believe, and be interested in turning to the next page to learn more; that's quite a mouthful, but we've all read a lot of bad science fiction over the years.With all that being said, this book hits it on most fronts - like Book One of the series I still can't pronounce the names of the alien races, but Book Two seems a bit rushed and incomplete to me.  There's not too much interaction with Daniel, and (without having a spoiler) I found a couple of the situations near the end a bit unrealistic.  The author did a great job setting the stage for ten years since the conclusion of Book One, then about two-thirds into the Kindle version it seemed as if there must have been a mad push to get this story told, completed, and out the door.  Many scenes could / should have been developed more as they were incomplete.I still enjoyed the series overall.  The author left it open at the end as if there might be a sequel, but I will probably wait and see what other reviewers think of it instead of immediately rushing out to buy it as I did with this one.  The author has a nice writing style, and I would like to see him try his hand at more sci fi.",A Little Comedown From Book One

1505,"This book had a steady flow, and the anticipation was building throughout.  Yes Liz was dead wrog for what she did, but in the end I really didn't see why she did it.  Darius seemed like the ideal man.  He had his faults,  but he certainly got better with age.  The book was great to me, there were really no lows, and it makes you want to read it str8 in one sitting.",Great read
1506,"Wow! I loved this novella so much, I bought the rest of Tuttle's books right away. The cover leads you to think these books are more Dresden Files (which I also LOVE to read), but don't let them fool you, Markhat is not Harry Dresden. I have loved Glen Cook's Garrett, PI books for years - eagerly awaiting every new one. Well, now there is able successor in Frank Tuttle's Markhat. A bit darker (what's not to love?), but just as lightly humorous with an interesting cast of fantasy characters living side by side with humans. No spoilers here - go buy the books yourself (make Tuttle some money, ok? He needs to buy more depilatory) and plan to read them all, one after the other. If you like gritty fantasy with a mystery, these books are for you. Frank Tuttle, get writing - we want more Markhat!","Move over Garrett, PI!"
1507,"I enjoyed the book and simply read over the typos. I got it as a free book and it was worth the read. Well developed characters. There is a lot going on in the book, it isn't simply a happily ever after. Worth the read. Hopefully they correct the electronic edition.",good story needs typo check

1511,"This book was good. I would've liked more history on the ""magic"". It was mentioned frequently towards the end of the story, but really vague. For that, I gave it 2 stars. I wanted to know about the relationship of the lead female and her parents. Again, they're mentioned, but that's it. This book has a good foundation but seriously lacks in the character development area. The chemistry between the lead characters is believable, but there's just not that much there. Good free read, glad I didn't pay good money for it.",A good free read
1512,What a beautiful book.  I was hesitant at first to read &#34;Indian Moon&#34; but I am so glad I gave it a chance. I was laughing and crying.... this book touches your heart.  5+++ Stars for McCray!!,BEAUTIFUL!!
1513,"Second in the Dragon Knights series, which is a different take on dragonriders; it resembles Anne McCaffrey's Pern books but is definitely for adult readers. The story starts with Lord Darian of Skithdron bedding a woman in a palace in order to gain access to secrets. He then decides that Lord Venerai and his ruler King Lucan are both deranged and evil.Two neighouring kingdoms, Draconia and Skithdron, are at odds and while the former boasts dragons as native beings, the latter has venomous serpentine beasts called skiths. These usually solitary creatures are being controlled for use in warfare by King Lucan. Adora, a healer woman, has just been seriously wounded by skiths and saved by a dragon, and now she is resting in the BORDER LAIR while her injuries heal. An older dragon knight called Jared, bonded to a female dragon called Kelzy, is caring for her and gradually falling for the courageous woman. Prince Nico of Draconia arrives and discerns that Adora is likely to be of lost royal blood, as she can 'hear' dragon speech and magically heal others.Belora, daughter of Adora, is also working as a healer, and mated to two dragon knights - women being scarce, the men willingly share a partner. Warfare is now waged openly between the kingdoms, the dragons flaming the skiths, which spit back acidic venom, while diamond-tipped crossbow bolts capable of piercing dragon scales are suddenly brought into use by the Skithdrons. Darius, fearing that the evil magic he has witnessed is taking over King Lucan, decides to defect in order to warn Draconia, thereby putting himself into grave peril. Meanwhile Adora is the subject of a well-meaning conspiracy by the dragon Kelzy, who decides that the woman requires two dragon knight mates.This is part of a complex series but can be read as a standalone, with sympathetic characters and well-imagined medieval warfare. Be warned, it features threesomes in a loving relationship between three life partners. Bianca D'Arc has written several books in this and her other fantasy series. I enjoyed this exciting tale and will be looking out for more of her work.",Border Lair
1514,I loved this whole series buy this book was probably my favorite.  It was awesome.  Highly recommend this author and this series in particular.,Great Series!
1515,"As I read this story I felt like a fan watching a crash at a NASCAR race. I kept trying to look away but I was drawn to see just how bad it could be. As 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' was to movies, this book is to Science Fiction.Stilted dialogue, complete ignorance of military aspects, one dimensional characters, abysmal grasp of science, a concept military vehicle that is so totally implausible that I laughed out loud, all blended together with a bizarre world view of how people behave. I kept thinking that the author was either brilliantly satirizing and mocking survivalist thinking or he was a horrifically bad writer. I still don't know.I gave the story two stars because the author made me determined to read book two of the series to find out.",Destined to be a classic
1516,"While I wholeheartedly agree that the lenghth of the book is disceptive that should not detract from an excellent story.  Give the publisher hell they deserve it.  Back to the story, it was great.  The author explores the fact tha HEA does not come without set backs and challenges.  The love of Z and Bella proves worthy of these challenges.  The story of the plastic surgeon and his wife was beautiful.  They are characters worthy of the series.  Inspite of its length the story rates a great read.",Loved It
1517,"This story was just ridiculous.  Rajah and Larkspur are completely out-of-place in this story - they speak like modern people (Larkspur likes to call a certain part of Rajah's body ""yummy"" frequently) and they're both supposed to be virgins but exhibit an amazing grasp of the mechanics and techniques of sex.  It keeps the reader from getting involved in the story at all - it's like reading an erotic story set in modern times that has somehow been gene-spliced with a story about a dragon and his human mate - and neither story benefits from the incongruity.Lark is also an annoying character.  She and her father were split up by pirates, she has no idea where he is, and she is kidnapped by a dragon.  She resists for about two minutes before deciding to spend the rest of her life with him.  I couldn't have much respect for somebody who didn't even care to find out how her father was or letting him know that she was okay.  And she's so demanding . . . ""do me this way,"" ""do me that way,"" ""do me this way.""  Rajah was talking about spending the next three hundred years with her . . . I give him a week and a half before he drops her back into the ocean, completely fed-up with her.",Ridiculous
1518,i was a little hesitant about this book. turns out this was a great book. i already ordered the next book. i love the characters and how this book keeps you guessing. would definitely recommend this book to others,excellent book
1519,I was not interested in the recommended books. Most seem to be female oriented.I also noticed a lot of female authors.,I was not interested in the recommend books
1520,"This story was about a sixteen year girl, Hailey Trosclair, who didn't seem to have much direction in life. She basically hung out with your older Brother Cyrus, and another girl named Meridian. She was a product of depressed mother and wayward father, so they did not pay much attention to her nor guide her. She eventually tries to get attention by trying to act older than she was and making some foolish decisions.I can't say that I enjoyed this book. Usually after I read a book, something stays with me in a form of a theme, message or just event. In this book, I am unclear of what the main objective was. I feel that the title does not connected with the actually story nor the characters. The writing style was okay for the most part, but the ending felt really rushed.This book did not provide a sense of closure for me. There did not seem to be a real resolution for the main characters. I would have liked a little more development/explanation for setup by Moses, and why he picked Cyrus as his avenger.In the end, this book left me feeling frustrated and let down. I did not get what the author was trying to communicate with his story. Maybe if I read it again, I will see the big picture.",Didn't connect with this book

1523,The first chapter is positively gross and disgusting.  That is as far as I could stomach to read this book.  I don't recommend it to anyone.,Do not read if you have a weak stomach
1524,"If you love the passion, the romance and the deeply intelligent dialogue of Regency Romance you won't like this book. The characters in this book, while intriguing, are horribly written. The supporting characters, supposedly two upstanding gentleman of the ton, speak as if they are dockside workers. The dialogue in the entire book lacks charisma and is choppy. The book takes you over dips and turns that have no part in the story. A VERY difficult book to force myself through. Save your time, you can never get it back!",Horribly written with many errors
1525,"After thoroughly enjoying the first book in the Travers Brothers series I ordered the rest of the series.  I think I made a big mistake.The second book in the series is not nearly as good as the first.  Instead of letting the story unfold, the author presents all of the background and most of the plot line in the first chapter.  It&#8217;s too bad because the basic premise of the book is pretty good - Clint Travers has loved Abby, his neighbor and best friend, since they were teenagers but were kept apart by her father, years later she returns home for her father&#8217;s funeral, engaged to another man, and Clint is determine to win her back.  Unfortunately there really isn't much story left to tell after the first chapter, the rest is predictable cheap romance novel fare.While the book is not so bad as to be rated 2 stars, it is not nearly as endearing or as interesting as the previous book.","Rushed and Predictable, 3 minus"
1526,"The first book in The Watchers series is an intriguing and fascinating vampire world.After escaping years of abuse as the prisoner of a brutal drug lord, Robyn Andrews boards the first bus out of town and heads for Louisville, Kentucky where a chance encounter with a stranger changes her life for the better? Watchers have one mission in life; to hunt and eliminate Rogue vampires and Trigg just wants to be left alone and do his job.  But he can&#8217;t seem to harden his heart against the petite woman who looks so lost standing in the rain.  He knows that that a future for them is impossible, she&#8217;s human, he&#8217;s a vampire, but she&#8217;s someone special. But the past is catching up and it has a way of changing destinies.This steady to fast paced plot keeps the reader engaged from beginning to end with well written scenes, vivid images and great compelling characters.  The author does such a fantastic job of giving these characters life that the reader can&#8217;t help but become enamored and want to know more.  As the reader gets caught up in the lives of Trigg and Robyn they are swept along with the Watchers missions as they battle the rogues and get their adrenalin pumping.The attraction between Trigg and Robyn is such a sweet passion that burns super hot at the same time.  The author conveys that chemistry and their relationship with such intensity that it captures the imagination. The reader can&#8217;t help but feel for these two characters, Robyn&#8217;s such a strong and sweet person that has been through hell and Trigg is this tough vampire that has such tender feelings for this lost waif, how can the reader not fall in love with them.  Even the sex scenes are contradictory in the fact that he is so sweet and tender but carries away by hot steamy lust that it takes the reader&#8217;s breath away.I can&#8217;t wait to read the next book in this wonderful and entertaining vampire world, Vane, Rosa and Rayne have definitely caught my attention and I want to know more about them as well as the Watchers.",Midnight Reborn Review

1533,"Heat of the Moment is the first book in the Out of Uniform series by author Elle Kennedy.If you are looking for a full length novel, look elsewhere.  This novella is just that -- a short story.  It comes in  at 78 pages according to Amazon and I want to mention that it is even shorter than that since the last 10 percent maybe of the book is previews for other stories.This is a sexy and short M/F/M menage read.  The main couple is John Garrett and Shelby Harper with the third person involved is Carson Scott. After pining for each other for a year, Shelby finally invites John and Carson up to her place after closing time.  She had the cafe open during a heat wave for the service men and she over hears Carson and John talking about how vanilla Shelby probably is.  Shelby is convinced to show them how un-vanilla she is by acting out her fantasy of two men at one time.I really enjoyed this short story and the writer made it believable.  While Carson was more of a third wheel in the story, he was a pivotal player in getting these two together.  Even though it does feature instant love after one night together with a small glitch of insecurities, I could actually see these two people together for the long haul.While it was in no means a book that will be above others, I will say that this short story was a great start to being introduced to this author for the first time.  If this had been a full length novel, I am sure it would have rated higher in my opinion. New readers of this author will get a quick thrill with John and Shelby and will be wanting to follow it up with the next novella in the series.",Review from My Overstuffed Bookshelf

I can  see this as a movie,it would make a geat and better horror movie than stuff out there today.Im sorry but PG-13 is NOT a horror movie.",Awesome and Interesting
1537,"Maybe I'm not as sophisticated as the other reviewers, but I really didn't dig this hero. Maybe I'm naive and too romantic, but I really wish I had known that not 6 hours after taking h's virginity, the hero would be bopping his ex (maybe not so ex) wife.When I first started the book, I was enjoying the Bridget Jones feel of the clumsy, awkward heroine, but the hero was no Mr. Darcy. When h first meets H, he's wearing a tee that says- Idaho  No Udaho. What guy wears that? I had to check to make sure this guy was really the H. He's cold and even mean to her in the beginning, so oblivious and egocentric, and Addie never once puts him in his place. I'm all for self-effacing but c'mon.Addie (the h) is beaten down by her ever-critical mother, her work colleagues, even by the H (Will). So when the psycho ex shows up unexpectedly, ruining Addie's post-coital glow, I wanted to scream. Just as Will rolls off her, his ex shows up, and Addie's made to hide out in the bathroom in confusion, only then to shimmy down a drainpipe, landing in the harsh reality of jerkdom.Addie slinks off home, and what does H do? He does his ex, as Addie is dealing with a nightmare of a morning-after. Ex asks him to make her feel better and he obliges. He blames it all on morning wood, sleep in his eyes and her hand down his pants. If only his backbone would stiffen up as quickly.He has yet to kick ex out, who has moved uninvited into his house. He just can't seem to tell her to get lost. He pretends to be drunk, passed out, asleep, all to avoid the ex. He even moves a dresser in front of his bedroom door in order to keep her out. Seriously.He decides he wants Addie, shows up at her house, sees her hugging some other guy (her brother), gets angry and flounces (yes, that's the word) off with his a** over his shoulder because she appears to be with someone else after having just been in his bed?! The injustice. The nerve.He does go to Addie to explain what happened, and she too quickly forgives him (he neglects to tell her he boinked the ex); I wanted her to make him grovel, to make him beg, to make him suffer. No such luck. She's too busy beating him back into the bed. Of course, it's a hotel bed, what with ex still entrenched in his house and all. Add to that ex's psuedo-suicide attempt and Will rushing to her rescue (the ex calls him while he's in bed with Addie, AGAIN), I just wanted to pull my hair out. This guy is unfreakingbelievable.I did not finish the book after that. So keep that in mind. Maybe you might like a lot of angst and what I'd call cheating. I know he and Addie weren't committed to each other, but I would really expect the hero? to wait at least a whole day before dipping his wick somewhere else and to know how to tell another chick to get lost. I personally just don't like that, and this is only my opinion. As I said, I couldn't finish the other half of the book. Does Addie stay with Will? Or does she fall for his brother Ed? Do they fight over her? What else does the evil ex come up with? I don't know and don't care. I just couldn't take anymore.ETAFinding the Right One, a follow-up featuring Will finding the right girl.",--- Spoilers ---

1539,"Enjoyed reading this book,  Robert Vaughan is on my list as a must read author.  Lots of action and was well written",Great reading
1540,"I'll start with the negatives. There are chains in these stories and they bind souls/minds together. I found it hard to really get into those. I love the image of the chains sticking out, but the entire mind-control and shared sexuality just didn't do it for me.Related to that, I felt the conclusion of this story didn't really seem sense. I'm not going to spoil it. I dislike stories in general where a single event suddenly has major changes across thousand year old cultures, all because a ""human"" got involved. I don't think we're that important and it takes a while for anyone to get used to a new idea.Now, on the positives, I love the telepathy. I love the play of mental forces as two people struggled to retain control of a relationship. Trying to find an equitable balance is a hard thing for all of us and I thought it was resolved in a satisfying manner.The sex was also fantastic. Lots of details and the entire domination aspect added a hot, slick tone to the entire story. I loved that bit and I'm willing to look past the bits I didn't care for.Would I get the sequel? Probably not, mainly because of my difficulties with the premise.","Didn't get the premise, but the execution was wonderful"

I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there, and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too.",Just Being Honest

1543,"I have read no other books by this author, so had no preconceived notions about what the book would be like. It was a (fictional) study in multiple personalities, told from Richard's point of view. The other &#34;people&#34; who inhabited Richard's mind did insert their viewpoints. I realize there are seriously ill people who have issues like the ones presented by Richard. That said, I had a hard time sticking with this story and learning how a serial killer &#34;rationalizes&#34; things in his/her mind. There was graphic sex and subtle violence. I personally do not like books of this nature. Nicholson does have a very good way with words but that doesn't make up for the awful parts of poor Richard's life.",Too Dark!!

The story left me wanting so much more.  I also really didn't like that the reader is beaten over the head that Bailey isn't a small woman.  It seemed as if every few pages we were told this over and over.  I found the story lacking in the erotica aspect too.  There were a lot of thoughts of what he/she wanted but not a lot of action.

However in this book during the first half it was the H who felt he wasn't good enough and the second half it was the h, plus she had other issues too. It was a bit too much for me to have both of them wavering and after they'd had an intimate relationship I would've liked to have seen more commitment, it wasn't realistic for the time period.",Could have been better

1550,"I loved this book. Victor has one of the most fascinating voices I've met.He is not bothered by his flaws and moderately interested in what happens around him if he's not involved. Things and people almost happen to him. He is absorbed in himself and at the same time he doesn't take himself too seriously. His psychic powers are an annoyance and he would clearly get rid of them if he could. Although he's been trained to use them, it's clear he didn't pay much attention during his classes and people around him always seem to know more than him. He tries to turn down his psychic abilities popping drugs like candies, but he's never hiding himself and he doesn't seek for excuses. He is what he is.At the beginning I thought the unconscious way he attracts Jacob Marks, who is his exact opposite, elegant, smart, sexy, was impossible to understand and I felt the author owed us some sort of explanation. Now I know it's not necessary. Jacob falls for Victor like I fell for him as a reader: fast, hard, with no apparent reason.This is the first book of a great series. I give it only four stars out of frustration because it's too short!",You'll love Vic!

1553,This was a great story and HOT. The characters seemed to get into it pretty fast which usually is a bad sign. However with this one you understand why that is pretty quickly. I understood why Amber felt the way she did as well as why Brian did. There was a pretty good twist at the end as well. It did feel like a grudge match there for a bit but the reasons are again clear. I think she reacted realisticly when put on the defensive. How do you go from having everything you ever wanted to letting it go without a fight. For Brian he had noticed her before but he had not grasped the fact that Amber had him on such a pedestal. It was a stroke of luck that they met again and while he was not happy with how things were moving along he was not going to just walk away from it no matter what it cost his sense of right and wrong. There were parts that made me want to cry as well but in the end it made for a happier ending. I am looking forward to reading more by Ms. McTark.,I agree with Natalie

1556,"This is the sequel to Snapdragon Alley, taking place about 18 years after the events of the first book.  Freak City is a much darker story than the first, and the characters have less charm.  I thought that Argus-as-a-child (from the 1st book) had great potential, but it would seem that he did not live up to it - though there are hints at the very end that things may change.The storyline was good, and the puzzle that Argus set out to solve was intriguing, but I also get the feeling that the author may have lost his grip on the story somewhat.  I won't provide spoilers, but there was one comment made at the beginning of the story that was never mentioned again - and to me, it seemed that that was the crux of the whole story.  I kept waiting for Argus to put two and two together and remember that comment, but it never happened.  Instead the characters danced around that issue without it ever coming to the fore (where I think it belonged).  This is supposed to be Book 2 of a trilogy, so perhaps the author intended it to 'lead up to' the finale in the 3rd book.All in all, a good little book (very short, probably novella length) with an interesting cast of characters.  It's definitely Number Two in a series, so readers should start with Snapdragon Alley in order to pick up the background.Note on Kindle formatting:  Perfect, or nearly so.  I did not note any issues that impacted readability.",Continues the story begun in Snapdragon Alley
1557,"This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered.  There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.  Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete, you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.

1566,"Review contains spoilersThe premise of the story sounded great. Two men who grew up together, one gay, the other straight have to marry/bond for their clans to strike a peace. You see the guys aren't just guys they are werewolves. So, we have two great cliches in one story: 1.) forced arranged marriage and 2.) paranormal/werewolves.However, while the story has some hot chemistry between the two leads, Hayden and Josh, the overall drama is told in flashbacks, which take away from the present day tale. Plus, Samhain nor the author don't warn for the out-of-the-blue rape that occurs to one of the heroes by some off-screen criminals (which did nothing to advance the plot), and seemed pointless. So I can only give the book 3 stars. The premise had promise, but did not come to full frution.",Werewolf drama

It took me longer to read than it should have because of that. Reformatting would definitely help you keep track of what is happening. I did feel that there were a few things that could have been left out of the story as they really weren't incorporated into the storyline very well, just seemed to be thrown in because you have to be explicit about some things (x-rated).

Yet there is a nice little plot interweaved  that is thoroughly enjoyable and allows you to convince yourself you're not just reading smut. *grin* Good characters, nice story, happy ending.Aside:The Badlands books are written by ""Elle Saint James"" but looking around it appears this is a pseudonym. Does this matter? Probably not. And I'm not going to say who I believe it is, 'cause that would be telling... Okay, it's not difficult to work out but where would the fun be in that? If an author writes under multiple names, there's usually a reason. Often the author is testing a different voice, or a different genre. In this case I suspect she is using it to delve into the cowboy menage genre (not really featured under her other name). And ""Elle Saint James"" is an excellent name for Wild West author.

1576,"""Oh yeah, come to the party,"" Emma had said. ""Simon will be there and he wants you,"" she said. When did that transform into getting torn to shreds by an evil bitch? Becky isn't about to let Livia get a piece of her without giving something back, but those sure are some strange sounds coming out of that woman. Finding out that your best friend, your best friend's new boyfriend, and the man you have been lusting after are other than human is a bit of a shocker, but Becky is no weak-willed lady Plus, she has to decide the fate of the bitch that had attacked her.When Simon finally gets Becky secured in his home, the Puma in him purrs. If he had any doubts at all about her being his mate, they had been erased at the scent of her blood and the sight of Livia crouched over her in the Friedelinde's garden. It was a good thing Becky had not even jokingly mentioned killing Livia as Livia's punishment for attacking her, because Simon would not have hesitated killing Livia for spilling his mate's blood. In fact, it had only been the fear in Becky's face, fear of him, that had stopped him from doing that anyway. He would have to work on that fear.We got a taste of the Simon/Becky romance in ""The Wallflower"", the story that introduced the Halle Pumas, but now they are back with a vengeance to resume their story in Sweet Dreams. Becky is as sassy as ever and Simon is sweet, strong, and sexy with a healthy dosing of protectiveness and possessiveness from both the man and the Puma. Seriously, what woman wouldn't love the guy? Though I have to say I'm rather glad Becky doesn't just fall all over him because this story is a great deal funnier for it. If I had one problem with this story it was that it was too darn short and that I didn't want it to end, but if that isn't the best recommendation I can give for a story, I just don't know what is.","the Halle Pumas, but now they are back with a vengeance to resume their story in Sweet Dreams."

1588,"Unlike a lot of reviewers, I don't agree that this is a bad novel or a waste of time. Some reviewers are arguing that this shouldn't be listed as a romance, I disagree with that as well, just because one half of the couple bites it (almost literally) doesn't disqualify the romantic aspect of the relationship, it's only love if both people make it? I think a lot of people are upset that there's no happily ever after in this book because that's what they've come to expect from a lot of UF novels, I much prefer the more realistic approach of this author, life and love most oft do not end the way we would like it to.I particularly like the authors writing style, he manages to convey emotion and emphasis sometimes with only few sentences composed of less than five words, stripped down to just the facts which functions much like a slap to the face, I find that this sometimes manages to convey more than the purple prose so many authors are fond of employing. Not to say that he doesn't at times get prosey, he does, however, when he chooses to do so it's appropriate and adds rather than detracts from the tale.  People complained about the violence and the drug use, but you know what, there are people out there that have lived and still live like that, kids like Molly who are snatched from their parents and forced into the sex trade, just because it makes people uncomfortable to know about it or read about it, doesn't negate it's existence.All of that is not t say that I didn't check out at some points in the novel, the excessive (and prosey) back story on Theroen bugged me and I did skip sections of it (only to come back and read it), but it does explain a good amount of the character's motivations and actions. The section where Molly was introduced was also a very difficult part for me, having volunteered with severely abused women and children most of whom had been trafficked from China, I'll admit to having a nightmare or two for a few days after reading and I had to set the book aside for a bit. The one thing that bothered me perhaps the most, was that Two decided to return to help Molly and the others only after she lost Theroen, her vampirism and needed to take Darren down for some quick cash. I almost stopped reading when she was rationalising away all the reasons why she shouldn't return for them. It would also have been good to understand why of everyone else, Theroen picked Two and what had been his criteria for doing so, had he been watching her? If so, for how long?Was this a good read? Yes. Would I recommend it to someone else? Definitely. I like the authors writing style, I appreciate that he wasn't afraid to take chances with a starting storyline I'm pretty sure he knew would rub a lot of people the wrong way, but he did it anyway and didn't sanitise it. I almost didn't pick this up because of some of the bad reviews, but I'm really happy that I ignored them and went ahead with it anyway.",Pretty Decent ********SPOILERS*******

1591,"Normally I love books on shifters and was eager to start this one.  And though the author had some intriguing ideas about werewolf culture, the book had one fatal flaw that I couldn't over look: artificial conflict.I can't stand it when the conflict in a story only comes as a result of the characters making stupid choices and putting themselves in unnecessary danger.  After promising multiple times not to put herself in danger, the heroine does exactly that the very first chance she gets, and willingly gives herself to the bad guys.  Plus, I don't think it was explained well enough about why the heroine was changed in the first place or why the bad guys wanted her so much.And the relationship between the two main characters progressed too quickly and unbelievably for me.  I found myself doing a lot of skimming while reading and ultimately gave up before the end.I gave the book 2 stars for the interesting bits of world building at the beginning.

1594,"I tend to cut this author a lot of slack.  I know when I order her book that the sex will be raunchy; there will be lots of foul language and an ambitious plot that loosely comes together.  Unfortunately, this story exceeded even my worst expectations.  The plot was weak and I found the characters so weak and unendearing that I couldn't even force myself to try to make sense of their silly background story. Chandra, the so-called heroine, was annoying with a capital 'B' and too contradictory.  I like a story with a strong but not militant Black female character and Chandra was no such character.  It was hard to believe that one, let alone two hotties would ever fall for this hot mess.  The only good thing about this book was this author knows how to deliver a good sex scene.  However, with the characters and storyline so lacking; this book was reduced to being on the level of a low-grade porn.  It was a HUGE disappointment.

Alex is a plucky heroine and displays some initiative, but I did get a little tired of Striker's Tarzan-like chest beating.

1597,Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this book but do wonder if the author was told she couldn't go over a certain word limit.I liked the characters and the book was well set up to be an interesting novel.  But instead I got a novella where the conflict lasted a single confrontation between the two main characters and the attempted murder mystery lasted all of a phone call from the hero to the sexy security guy.If either of these events had been stretched to encompass a chapter or two the book would have been so much better.  The players were in place but the game never happened and the reader was deprived of what could have been a really good book and instead got some really good sex scenes.If you'd like an hour or so of entertainment buy this book.

1600,"I mostly enjoyed this story. Other people have described the plot, so I'll just give my impression. This story was entertaining and kept my attention throughout. However, I found it hard to really engage because some of the characters weren't very likable to me. First, Maud's cousin Barbara is flat-out rude. She's often rude to Maud and says mean things, and Maud never really stands up to her. There's no backstory to Barbara to really flesh her out as a more 3-dimensional character, either. Further, Maud's boyfriend in Sweden, Lukas, is mean-spirited, self-absorbed, and also relatively one-dimensionsal, although the author does attempt to make him deeper through letters written by Maud's mother many years ago. This effort is a clever one but it didn't quite come together, as Lukas never makes it back from the negative image painted of him throughout most of the book. Finally, Maud's stepmother Kathleen is also quite one-dimensional. Although she really only shows up in a couple of scenes, as an important part of Maud's life some attention should have been paid to developing her personality.Overall, like I said, engaging enough to keep me occupied and I was never bored with the story. I only wish the characters were more fully developed.",Entertaining light read

1604,"This was an absolute gem.  I was laughing throughout the entire story.  It's a quick read, but packed full of action and comedy.  I don't know if I could have laughed that hard for much longer - the length made a good match for the tightly-packed story.  Trying to string the action and laughs out to make the story longer or trying to add more in to the story just would not have created the same punch.The action and laughs start from the very beginning.  Who would have thought that a medium would counsel sexually-frustrated ghosts so that they can transcend from the earthly realm?  Not only a fresh idea in paranormal stories, but a riot of laughs at the antics Andrews provided for the characters.Looking forward to reading the full-length novels in the Karma Consultants series.",Fun and Quick Read

1606,"This story did not really succeed at anything. I didn't hate it, but neither did I enjoy it. I found myself struggling to finish it. I just didn't care. It wasn't science fiction or fantasy, there wasn't enough detail about the world or it's customs. They were only hinted at and aluded to. It certainly wasn't erotica, there was no sensuality and very little sexuality. It was really only a romance in that the epilogue hinted at an HEA.I did not become vested in the emotions of either main character. They just were not defined enough for me to care. They were both rather two dimensional. The events were distasteful, which is fine if you are vested in the characters and rooting for them to triumph over adversity. Unfortunately, I didn't care enough about the characters to overcome the nastiness of the situation they were in. There wasn't enough emotion between the characters to make me believe they felt anything for each other, beyond the physical desire that was forced by magic. Not a good enough reason to believe they loved each other.I think I would have been unhappy if I had paid actually money.",master of none
1607,"The only thing that got me to the end of this story was sheer cussedness.  The storyline was flat, there was absolutely no character development, and the dialog was from a cheesy porn.  I found myself increasingly disgusted with the female lead and her whining.  In no way did I find myself sympathetic to the protagonist nor did I find myself even caring what made him who he was.  There was no back story to explain what brought the main characters to this point of the book.

I also thought she should grow up and stop getting her sister out of jams - if she'd stop helping her I think her sister wouldn't be so bad. Enabling!The BDSM elements are good - very light compared to other stories I've read. The concept of a kidnap fantasy features in many a female's psyche (whether they want to admit it or not) and this story lets you play that out in the safety of words. The inner dialogue of the characters is very important and is done fairly well here. It seemed about the right length.

She couldn't go on the way they had been.  They were no more than roommates, and she decided to either shake things up, or let go and move on.  It had truly shocked her that he seemed to take it in stride until he saw her dancing with someone else one night at Ziggy's.  Quinn had lost his temper, and that gave her some hope, but when he walked away not wanting to cause a scene, she was ready to give up.When Quinn showed up at the library waiting at her car, Libby didn't know what to think.  Hearing him ask for a second chance, and his proposition that she spend a weekend alone with him, she didn't know what to think.  Libby was further surprised to hear his agreement that he would give her time to think after their time together that was uninterrupted and free from pressure.  They had been so far apart from each other the past year that Libby was afraid to get her hopes up.  Knowing this was their last chance, she skeptically agreed.This was a different spin in that we witness the demise of a good marriage between two basically kind hearted people.  They allowed other issues come between them, and instead of tackling them head on, they tried to deal with them alone separating them farther.  Can these two find the path back to each other?

I love erotica as much as the next person but this story left me feeling like M is just a big ol ho.

1625,"Angels' Pawn is an introduction to the world that we'll learn more about inAngels' Blood(due out 3/3/2009). A world where angels and vampires not only co-exist, but have an interesting connection. As a Guild Hunter, one of those that hunts rogue vampires down for the angels, Ashwini finds herself suddenly stuck between two vampire factions, and the angel wanting to manipulate them all, in Atlanta. She turns, for help, to Janvier, a vampire himself - who may have his own reasons for assisting her.From the first moment I started this novella I was immediately immersed in the world. I couldn't have stopped reading if there was a fire. Okay. I hope I could have at least paused to get out of the building, but you get the picture.I'm continually amazed by Nalini's ability to create fully realized characters, especially in novellas where the shortened format makes that difficult for a lot of authors. Angels' Pawn is no different. Ashwini is a compelling character from her first moments pounding on a door. I'm completely intrigued by her, and really hope that we get to see more of her in the future.Janvier. Wow. What can I say except I want to meet him. A native from the bayous, with an old world charm, and an, apparently, innate sexiness, he is just fantastic. Watching him play off of Ashwini, lightening the mood and at the same time ratcheting up their relationship throughout everything they were trying to accomplish in Atlanta was truly a joy.I can not wait to read Angels' Blood which focuses on Elena and Raphael, I believe. But I'm really hoping to see more from Janvier and Ashwini in the future. Their storyline was by no means complete - although the main conflict is tied up in the novella - we have lots more to hear about this pair.Nalini's said it, but I'm going to give this warning to those that need an HEA. This is not a typical romance with a bow-tied HEA at the end.It's a fantastic read, a great introduction, and I highly recommend it.

HKW breaks apart the sometimes stale archetypical vampire mythos and manages to create a daring action-packed story in Redeemer.Well-researched biblical lore here.  The author states in the Foreward that she holds a degree in Religious Studies, and it shows.  Believers may be challenged by a premise that appears blasphemous.  After first reading the Amazon reviews, I wondered just how open-minded I would be?  HKW does a great job in cross-fertilizing the paranormal and biblical themes.  However, her somewhat negative viewpoint on religion in general may be off-putting to some readers.This was a page-turner for me.  Lots of twists and turns in the plot and the characters were well-defined and likeable.  I did find myself irritated by the ""baby-talk"" dialogue device though.The world-building lacked a little as she slowly revealed the vamps' powers.  The ending was a tiny bit stock and the story left me with lots of unanswered questions.  Guess that's what sequels are for!

It just stops and heads off in a different direction.In the end it leaves you thinking the author is more interested in publishing strings of words then in creating quality content.As with many free e-books, the last half of this short work is tidbits from other published works by the author.

1651,"At first, I was thrilled with the purchase of this book.  The last chapter or two though, it seemed as if the author stopped trying.  Luckily, it was a short book and I was able to finish it.I was a little disappointed that Pearl never changed in the story, more than a couple claw-lengthening type changes when she was upset.  Plus, I was extrememly disappointed in a VET and a self-professed animal lover's irresponsible pet ownership.  I mean, come on, neither apparently believed in training their dogs, and it never occured to either of them to spay and neuter the two of them before throwing them together at Pearl's house?  The inevitable result of THAT bright idea (or lack thereof) and the fact that the author really seems to have no real idea about dogs, (Labradoodles are NOT a breed, they're mutts, and therefore you really can't make generalizations about their traits, and now not only are you adding more mutts to an overpopulated world, you are breeding a dog with a bite history...UGH!) is what knocked this book from a four-star to a three-star for me.  I tend to lean towards write-what-you-know, and if you don't know about it, leave it out of the book school of thought.Also, this book does contain a little bit of anal play.  I'm not a fan of fingers-in-rear-ends, but fortunately it was only a sentence or two in a couple scenes and easy to skip over, if it's not your thing either.I haven't decided if I will be purchasing any other books in the series or not.

1657,"I'm not much of a romance fan, but this story sounded like just the thing to cleanse my literary palate for the new year. The fact that it's relatively short and just 99 cents definitely helped. But frankly, I was a little disappointed.First, the other reviewer's comment about the formatting for Kindle was spot on. Bizarre characters, strange indenting, chapter titles that start at the bottom of a page, typos - it needs some cleaning up. It's very distracting when you're trying to get into a story. That said, the formatting in no way influenced my rating.The Haircut is a wonderful concept but the execution could have been better. The back and forth in the barber shop went on *forever* using the same words and phrases. I understand that the barber was conflicted about the girl's request. I understand the girl wanted it done ""like the boy's haircut."" But the characters just kept saying the exact same thing. I enjoy scenes of conflict but this one just got tedious.As I said, I don't read romances so perhaps this is a common device, but the repetition throughout seemed to be included to simply fill space. It was so distracting and frustrating, in fact, that I simply stopped reading about 60% in. I mean, the ending isn't any secret, is it?So why did I give it three stars? It's a lovely story, and I really enjoyed learning a little about Misha. I also think tightening it up by about a third would make this a very readable little gem.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!",A Diamond in the Rough

While out looking for a breach Mac and Blake, vampires, run into a group of humans and they begin to help them look for the breach.  It's then they meet Kate.  Mac instantly starts to fall for Kate but Blake is only going after Kate to anger his sire, Mac, or at least that's how it starts out.

Of course, Will was super sexy and could make a girl swoon.~BookWhisperer Reviewer MC~",BookWhisperer Reviews: Heat of the Storm
1663,"3.5 Stars~Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogIf you&#8217;ve read Heat of the Moment, then you&#8217;re already familiar with Carson Scott. He&#8217;s a SEAL, a wild and sexual guy but the only different between him in this book and the guy from the last book is that Carson doesn&#8217;t want to be the one-night-stand guy anymore. He wants commitment and he wants a relationship.Unfortunately for him, Holly Lawson, the girl he had a hot quickie with in the supply closet of a club, doesn&#8217;t want to date him. She just wants a fling. As Holly proposes an affair, Carson is trying to get a hold of his feelings for Holly.In an explosive mix of chemistry, sexual tension and a heady dose of dirty talk, HEAT OF PASSION  ignites with a fiery passion. Kennedy doesn&#8217;t wait long to turn the heat up. In fact, she jumps right in, whether you&#8217;re ready or not.Though too short to really create a concrete romance between the two, this short story is a hot quickie, perfect for a little pick-me-up if you need something a little more spicy in your reading material.",Though too short to really create a concrete romance between the two
1664,Wings of the night part 1 so happy to have a chance to revisit this series.  Cannot wait for more,Lovely series
1665,"as per first review I bought one then the next two and have enjoyed them all, a bit long winded i bits but my favorite characters keep me going to the end",good follow on
1666,"I absolutely agree with the reviewer who said that the author of this book had a great premise but a poor execution.  I was very intrigued by the first couple of chapters, but as the story wore on, my interest and patience flagged.This book introduces Preston 'Press' Andrews.  After the initial engaging description of the crime and its perpetrator, we are led into 'timeline' chapters.  By chapter 14 we are not even 12 hours removed from the beginning of Preston's part of the story, but we have been 'treated' to agonizing and saccharine descriptions of this apparent super hero/detective, and yet very little about the actual crime investigation.  We know how tall Preston is and how much he weighs, the color of his eyes and hair, how muscular he is, how he dresses in Armani apparel and Italian leather loafers, how wealthy he is, how amazing he is...but still humble, how his nickname around the precinct is 'Super Dick' (tee-hee!) because he can solve ANY crime, how beautiful his sister is, how she has long, long legs, about her bra-less breasts (these points noticed by Preston himself...ewwwww), and pretty much how superior Detective Andrews is to all the mere mortals around him.We also get to know a tiny bit about Preston's new partner, Trace Evans ('Press' and Trace...those are not names, they are verbs).  Trace is a new detective, but is treated like a fresh out of the academy rookie beat cop.  Preston looks for signs that Trace is going to be sick at the sight of the victim's body.  Although I am far from an expert on police matters, I was under the impression that it takes a while to work up to being a detective, and by the time a police officer has achieved this designation they have probably already seen their fair share of gruesome sights.  Apparently this is not so in Trace's case.  It seems it is up to Preston to take young Evans under his wing and show him the ABC's of police work, while simultaneously looking like a GQ model, comforting all the rich people in town, making amends with (and surreptitiously leering at) his sister, navigating an amicable break up with his girlfriend (amicable in large part due to how fabulous 'Press' is), and finally, getting the upper hand in an ongoing feud with the big, bad meany Motor Pool officer in charge (insert dramatic music here).Does this sound tedious?  If so, imagine slogging through this mire the entire first half of the book.That's as far as I got.  I deleted this from my device at 54% as I surmised that a great deal more of the text would likely deal with the author's worship of her protagonist rather than the exploration of who committed the crime and why.  I sensed there would likely be some silly wrap up of the mystery with...you guessed it!...'Press' coming out the hero.  No thanks, I'll pass.","Beginning Was Intriguing, But Then Fell Flat"
1667,"The best thing about the book is its cover. I couldn't get into the characters and felt the whole premise was unbelievable. There are those who will enjoy the quick break from reality that reading this book provides; unfortunately, I'm not one of them.",Unfulfilling
1668,"Martha is an empath and because of this a recluse. She buys an antique mirror with strange symbols on it and learns it is not all it appears to be, it leads her to the man of her dreams. Silas is a Scottish wolf shifter who spies Martha and recognizing her as his mate he convinces her to stay with him, then proceeds to capture her heart.The author writes a decent sentence the storyline is cohesive and the dialogue smooth. The steamy scenes were abundant, detailed, and sizzling, but I had some major problems with this book.First, I really don't like when a book goes from zero to one hundred in the first few pages. Martha and Silas were having sex before you even knew anything about their personalities or could form any kind of emotional attachment. Silas remains pretty two dimensional throughout. There was no build up, no flirting, no draw to help you feel the chemistry between them it was disappointing, and there were so many steamy scenes in the beginning that I started skipping through to get to the meat of the story.Second, Silas is described as the usual alpha male big, buff, and bad, most women's ideal fantasy man. Then Martha is described and she is plain and over weight.....now just hear me out. I understand that we all come in different shapes and sizes I am not perfect either but this is fantasy, so when I read I am visualizing the scene as the author describes it, why would I want to fantasize about a beautiful man having sex with an over weight unattractive woman. I want to leave the reality outside of my books, authors never design the lead man as scrawny, plain, and timid....that's because women wouldn't like it. I get that she is trying to appeal to the audience by saying here is a hot guy going for the everyday women, but throughout the book Martha is describing herself, an introvert with plain looks, hair, and an over weight figure and coming to terms with the fact that Silas doesn't care, but to me it disturbs the romance of the book....it's a turn off. I felt as though Martha really didn't like herself, so guess what I had a hard time liking her as well. If you are going to have a character described as less than ideal I would accept it much better if she were confident with what she has, not insecure. Make her big, sassy, and proud.Lastly, there really wasn't much to the book other than steamy scenes and that became tiresome if you took those out it would be a very short novella, so if you want an unemotional erotic romance then this book is for you. This is my first read by this author so maybe her other books are different, better? I got this for free and would be hard pressed to purchase any of her other books or continue this series. Enjoy!",Could have been better!
1669,"Woohoo, just added another series to my library list.  This is exactly the kind of books I like:  dominant alpha male possessive over his mate.  Tienan is a trained killer, but he feels a protectiveness towards Silence from the moment they meet.  And of course, the meeting was perfect.  Silence was tracking him to give information to the leader of the Resistance (her adopted brother), but the hunted became the hunter.  And the game is on!!  This was a very good read.  Anyone who likes dark cold mysterious guys who finds that one woman to soften them, will love this story.  Now I'm moving on to the second story in this series.",Added another series to my library...
1670,Really too short to even review.  Not sure what was up with the necklace.  Ended in a way.  Puzzled about all of the plot.  Product description longer than story...lol,a magic necklace i guess

1672,I love it.  If fits snugly into the Kindle Fire.  I wish the cord was a little longer so I can charge & use the device at the same time.,Works quickly
1673,"This book reads like the work of a talented teenager. It lacks any evidence of writing belong a high school essay. Emotion on the part of the main character consists of getting upset stomaches. Chapter five seems to be a rewrite of a similar chapter in McKinley's 'The Blue Sword'. Perhaps the author will someday develop the ability to write at a professional level, but there is no evidence of it here. Others have complained of the editing. I see no issue with that in the version I downloaded. 99 cents may be two high a price to pay for this book.",Any one can write

1675,It was fun to read this book and how it kept me guessing until the end. Enjoyed the plot and how it kept me guessing on til the end. Good reading,Fun to read
1676,"Disclaimer: I got this for my Kindle when it was being given away for free.  It now is up to $2.80 but my review takes into account what I paid.I like Markhat the finder, a hard-boiled ex-military gumshoe in a fantasy land where trolls, vampires, and other creatures of the night interact with humans.  This novella/short story has some great dialog and I truly wish it had been longer.  I even paid $2.00 for another Markhat book, The Mister Trophy, hoping for more of the same and while it was equally as good as this book it was also equally as short.  If I consider the combined content of both books and consider the $2 I paid for them, I still rate them 5 stars.Apparently there is a third, longer Markhat book out now which for some reason isn't available for the Kindle.  Come on Frank, what are you and Samhain waiting for?",I like Markhat
1677,"NASCAR driver Jake Henson takes refuge near the White River in Arkansas Ozarks National Forest; he is physically recovering from a boating accident that left him injured and his best friend dead.  Next door to the cabin he borrowed is Stacy Carter, and her Yorkie Oscar; she borrowed her brother's cabin to escape the media who have made her, daughter of a notorious politician, into an amazon because she disarmed a thief.Oscar introduces the temporary neighbors to one another.  Each is instantly attracted, but both hides their history from one another as he believes she detests publicity and she assumes he will detest her roots.  Besides this is a short fling in the hills.  Neither expected love to meet them at the finish line, but though they must reveal what they concealed, they fear the relationship will end once the checkered flag is dropped.ALMOST FAMOUS is a fun contemporary romance starring two celebrities taking a respite from fame.  Jake and Stacy are likable characters while Oscar is cute as he believes he is a raging Doberman.  Fans will enjoy the story of two people hiding critical parts of their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s from their beloved.Harriet Klausner",a fun contemporary romance
1678,"Even though I did not read all four, and read out of order (the ones I did) that does not hamper the stories overall.  Yes,  series type are best read in order.  However, even though parts of series and more could be related for knowing previous - I still believe the stories I have read in this series can stand alone.  Which I prefer as I hate to be beholden to reading serial type works.  Good show that as (seeming these days) I run into many that really require all be read and in order.In this one we find Argus a college graduate, a loner who comes into a mysterious package thrust on him at busstop.  The tale unfolds as Argus and his co -worker and roommates try to figure out what the package contents mean and why/how related to Argus.  Again, this author shows creative abilities with his premise and the pieces that seem random - but ultimately tie together.  This one is related to a supernatural place and supernatural events.  As is the other one I read (likely all four are).  The supernatural bits are not overdone or ""hokey "" to this reader and while it seems to jump around a bit - I believe this is due to various people working their part of the puzzle and author intent versus just jumping around without cohesive plot planned.I really enjoy reading this author's work. I just find the numerous grammar and punctuation errors distracting and reduced the rating one star for such.  As the errors are quite numerous.Regardless of errors, many will enjoy this read if they like the genre.Christine","i did not read all, nor in order"
1679,"The Code of Hammurabi, from the third millenium B.C.E., was an attempt to encode various laws into a fairly straight forward justice system. Numerous specific crimes are mentioned, along with very specific punishments. Most of the crimes revolve around things dealing with farming, buying and selling things, and debts.Punishments ranged from paying a fine (in money or goods/animals), to somewhat much more severe, like having a hand cut off, all the way to death. Some of the things I found most interesting are as follows:Threaten a witness? You die.Judge makes a mistake in giving the penality? Out of a job.Steal. Depends who you steal from. If you're rich, you pay 30 times the amount stolen; if poor, you pay ten times the amount stolen. The laws seemed to be fairly balanced in this way, the penalty in money or goods higher for the rich person than for a poor person.If a woman opens a wine house? She dies.If a wife has sex with some other guy and is caught, they are tied together and drowned.If a wife is very ill, the guy can take another wife but must still take care of the first one.If a son has sex with his mother and they are caught, both are burnred to death.If a son strikes a father, one of his hands is cut off.If a guy causes another guy to lose an eye or break a limb, the same will be done to him.If a guy hits a pregnant woman and she dies, thus losing the baby, then, if the guy has a daughter, she dies.There's also a whole section on the fees various people can charge, including doctors, vets, house builders and ship builders.All-in-all a very harsh system of laws, but in some ways, especially the rich paying a much stiffer penalty than the poor, most fair than today's laws.",Harsh laws but some fair points
1680,A real cute short story with interesting characters. I would love to see more with the same characters to see how their relationship develops.,Cute
1681,"This is my second Kinsey Holley book, to hit my top shelf.  Top shelf means: I have read this book more than twice and *know* I will read it again.I was very hesitant to read about about a previous brother sister relationship.  Not my style, but the more I read this book the more I realized these two have virtually no ties.. other than a an adopted relationship. They never even grew up together. I loved this story (almost as much as her other books). It sucked me right in and I loved every inch of their relationship.. Lark is a wonderful character, strong with vulernabilities but the same can be said for Taran. Wonderful couple, loved the book.",Another top shelf hit
1682,"The book had 2827 locations on my kindle. The book was about a woman named Kelsey and a cop named Clint. Clint and Kelsey had supposedly hated each other, but secretly lusted after each other. Calliope, a friend of both Clint and Kelsey, believed the two, were perfect for other. Calliope dies, in her will, she states, Kelsey and Clint, live in her house for eighteen months, at the end of that time, they can sell the house and split the profits.  The best case scenario would be for the couple to live happily ever after. There were a couple of good detailed and vivid sex scenes, which I liked. The book contained a couple of spanking scenes, which in my opinion were not harsh. I liked the Clint character. He was firm, very loving, a no nonsense kind of guy.  I did not like the Kelsey character. She made decisions, which made me want to smack her. There was too much indecisiveness from both Kelsey and Clint. &#34;I hate him, her&#34; &#34;I want him, her&#34; which got on my last nerve. NOT one of Faulkner's best, this was a 3 for me.","Sandra's View ""ok read"""
1683,This story is a great continuation in the series. I loved it and enjoyed just like all the others. The characters just continue to grow on me as I read this series. Can't wait to read the next one.,Amazing
1684,"I could have gone without all the I love you, I love you too, I love you more type of writing. This was to drawn out, the story would have been good at half the length.  Also to many editing errors for me to enjoy and I don't remember reading a book that had what someone was thinking in quotes, that was weird. I only got 40% thru it and gave up.",Very long and mushy
1685,"Soul Hunger is a book that suffers from a well-known ailment: ""first-book syndrome"". The author clearly has a world that she wants to develop, but unfortunately tries to do so all in the first chapter. Paragraph after paragraph of expository background.  The cast of characters is stereotyping 101. We have the tough, scary leader, his straight talking right hand man, the bookish historian and the lover that no one ever rejects (and a couple of less developed others - I guess in case the series needs expanding). Now I know what I'm reading.  When I'm looking at books like this, (as the blurb says: Mehen must protect mortals from the undead... has never struggled with the task--until he saves a woman from three undead, and finds himself in need of saving) I know I'm not passing through the frosty upper echelons of high literature. As a result, my expectations were not that high. Overall, it's not a bad story, it's just not a *good* story.  The plot is roughly handled with some chapters reading as filler between random and pointless sex scenes. The main female character is so bland she was almost irrelevant.There are also the odd turns of phrase that an editor should have caught, ""she had never seen a better looking man in person in her entire life."" That really is just clunky writing. And then there's, ""she regarded him with a small amount of fear lurking in her eyes"". An amount of something cannot lurk. Fear can lurk in her eyes sure, but an ""amount""?  The English language just doesn't work that way. This is what a decent editor should have picked up on and polished with the author.Also a little more attention to word choice is necessary, ""I'm sure just being here with you will cause Mehen to wale on (me)."" Wale is a horizontal wooden strip for a boat, according to the dictionary. The right homophone is ""wail"", spelt just like the sound. This isn't being picky - if you're going to ""publish"" then you need to do it right.Add to that the clunky plot development and inability to  handle the many characters in the story and you have a book that is a bit of a mess. I imagine with practice and an editor who is more attentive, this writer could improve.  Overall, it's readable and as such is worth it's price: $0.00.",It's...readable
1686,"If you can live with a story line that has previously been used by literally dozens of regency writers before her, and a ""mystery"" that is painfully thin, the characterizations and the writing style aren't bad. I wouldn't recommend this particular book (especially at this price), but the author's ability to write does leave room for hope if you run into one of her other books with a storyline you like.",Predictable fare without so much as a hint of originality

1688,"I am going to attempt to remain professional throughout this review, but I may fail miserably. I have always had an interest in cryptozoology, so naturally when I saw this book I knew I had to read it. After having done so, I honestly feel like this might have been a rejected manuscript from the Syfy Channel.The writing is just plain bad. The story reads like the manuscript to a B movie and the plot is predictable. The opening of the book describes the creature in too great of detail. From that point on what is going to happen is rather painfully obvious. I do have to give credit for the cover though, it might be the very best part of the book.","Not a ""hurts so good"" situation."

An answer that is mutually beneficial to him and his new bride, and that will hopefully finally quell the gay rumors swirling around Hollywood's latest superstar. Kiona would never have guessed she would have to take such drastic measures as to marry a stranger but if it's between that and losing the home and the man she loves she's willing to do what ever it takes. Nothing prepared Kiona or Mitch for the instantaneous attraction that resulted in their initial meeting or the interesting secret the love of her life Kol has been keeping from her. A secret that just might help the union between three people become a triad made in heaven. That's if they can protect each other from Kiona's manipulative father before he wrecks all of their lives for good.In a story that shows what people are willing to do during desperate situations, Kabana Heat entices readers with the beauty and allure of the Hawaiian Islands and its exotic inhabitants. From the first page the stage is set when Hollywood actor meets island vixen and even as she tries to fight the heat they produce just from being near each other, Mitch is not so willing to loose a chance at experiencing how her passionate nature would translate in the bedroom. In steps the jealous and also bi-sexual lover of the heroine and this book takes off on one emotional situation after another. Feelings are dangerous enough without adding in jealousy, hurt and meddling parents who won't let go. Titania Ladley did an interesting job of setting of these three and the only thing I would have liked to see differently maybe a slower build-up between the two men. It was a little hard to swallow that two men who were so far in the closet would jump out within one meeting.

Yay!I have to say that I loved Kaylee! I loved how she so adamantly claimed she wasn't crazy, and even did the rational thing and took the drugs, even though she knew she didn't need them. I also loved how funny she was - telling someone that she was in the institution because she didn't speak, and telling one of the therapists that she was only there because the doors were locked! Loved that one! I really felt for her though. It would kill me to be locked up in an institution somewhere and have people telling me that I was crazy because of circumstances out of my control. How awful to also suddenly start screaming and not be able to stop too! Really awful, and so embarrassing!I thought the storyline here was pretty unique. I've read books before where people know when people are going to die, but I've never come across something like this!

1705,"I confess it's difficult to convey in a few short words just how utterly bad this novel really is!The premise is certainly sound enough and, frankly, that's what prompted me to pick up this. The second coming of the Christian Messiah is at hand as a result of the deeply undercover cloning of Christ's DNA from blood recovered from the Shroud of Turin by a group of religious separatists known as the Vinces.THE SON OF MAN is clearly Christian fiction and one doesn't have to hunt very hard to see the clear parallels to the biblical story of the birth of God's son - the nativity star is represented by a rogue asteroid on a collision path with earth; the immaculate conception is presented via the impregnation of illegally cloned cells into a young virgin; the trek to Bethlehem is re-created as the struggle to reach Omaha, Nebraska, the anticipated ground zero of the collision with the asteroid; and the gift-bearing magi make an appearance as a kindly doctor and a Nobel Laureate physicist. There's even a John the Baptist character who ensures that nothing stands in the way of the birth of ""the Father's only begotten son"".I'll hand one kudo (and one kudo only) to CW Johnson. He definitely has the writing chops to create first rate suspense when it comes to describing the impending apocalypse that would be caused by collision of a mountainous asteroid with the heartland of America. Frankly, that's the only reason I actually finished this dog-eared mutt. But that's it! From a purely writing point of view, the plot is seriously disjointed and outrageously difficult to follow, sub-plots are willy-nilly injected and summarily dropped and the characters are cartoonish and thinly developed. Maria, for example, the stand-in for the mother of Christ on this second stab at converting the world, is a virgin only because she's a neurotic, egocentric,waspish whiner that no self-respecting man would stay with long enough to roll into bed.If one examines this novel from a thematic point of view, the theology is a joke and is an excellent example of the many reasons why I am a rabidly anti-Christian deist hanging tentatively by my fingernails on the edge of atheism. (And I know I'm not alone) That a self-centered, narcissistic God would make a second appearance to the world because we screwed up the receipt of his first message and failed to give him his due obeisance; that he would choose to make his appearance through the worldly efforts of a renegade group of arrogant theologians convinced that the end justifies their illegal means; that he would enlist a pederast, murderers, thugs, drug runners and extortionists as his advance earthly agents; that this so-called God would create havoc, mayhem, destruction, heartbreak, chaos and the foundation for a world-wide nuclear war as the climate for his second coming ... well, it's all more than laughable. It's the reason why there is so much antipathy today toward organized religion in general and Christianity in particular.If that's the God that Christian dogma has on offer, then give me the apocalypse but leave me alone after I'm dead and gone. That's one God that I don't care to ever meet.Paul Weiss",That this represents a major world religion is a terrifying reality!

These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.",Worthwhile addition to the New Jedi Order

1709,"In the second installment of the Granite Lake Wolves series two high school sweethearts who have more in common than they ever could have imagined are reunited when one's life is threaten and another's is falling apart.Tad Maxwell is half wolf, half human and will not come into his wolf unless he has sex with someone else of his kind. But Tad refuses to give into his wolf and a meaningless liaison, his human side and principals rule too strong. And so he fights every day to bury that part of him. Until the girl he once loved shows up and turns his world upside down.Missy Leason is running from her pack and almost out of time. A viscous alpha wants to claim Missy and use her for her Omega powers, willing to break both human and wolf laws if that means a rise in his own power. Missy hopes that Tad can save her but that means confessing secrets and convincing him that they're more than just first mates, they're true mates. But when Missy's Alpha finds them she may not get the chance because Tad must face him in a fight...without the ability to shift into a wolf like his adversary.Wolf Flight was another great story from Vivian Arend, this time starring Robyn's (Wolf Signs) brother, Tad. With suspense and action that will keep you turning the pages for more and naughty sex scenes with frustrating tension, Wolf Flight had a fuller feeling to it then the first book in the series despite it's shorter length.Tad and Missy's story almost run side-to-side of Robyn and Keil's time-wise, so you get to see Tad's feelings on his sister's mating as well as his own. A sweet and likable character, I really enjoyed Tad. Missy was also a good character, determined and aggressive when it came to getting what she wanted (Tad) yet still soft and womanly. I'm looking forward to the next book!","Wolfy action and romance, what's not to love?"

1711,"I read this in a couple of hours.It's the prequel to the Fallon Mates series.A little back ground into what the series is about and what happened on the home planet of the Vesti and the Amato, Belizair. Originally they were The Fallon. They separated into the 2 different species. Years later while at war with the Hotaling, another species who want their planet, they were infected with a weaponized virus that has prevented the females of both from falling pregnant. The Fallon, winged beings that once walked the earth and were revered as angels and demons. Some mated with the humans and so the genes were created.In order to prevent the extinction of their species the scientist have found that if 1 Vesti and 1 Amato male take a human female mate with the Fallon gene they are able to make babies. If a female Amato and a male Vesti take a male human with the gene they are also able to make offspring.This prequel explains how it came to be that both the Vesti and Amato were needed to create the babies.Liath d'Amato has been on earth as a bounty hunter. He offered his blood as others did and the scientists have found him a match. Her name is Cyan Dupre. She is an artist. After meeting Cyan, Liath starts to have dreams about the life he and Cyan will have once they are bonded. In the dreams he sees that the only way to happiness and offspring, is if he and his partner Rykken d'Vesti both claim Cyan as their bond mate. He spends time getting to know her and takes her to stay in a cabin. As much as he wants to mate with her, he believes the dreams are a true seeing. He goes back home to convince Rykken to come back to mate with Cyan.Rykken agrees to go back to earth and meet Cyan. As soon as the car pulls up and he sees her on the porch in the headlights, the Vesti mating frenzy takes hold. He must have Cyan, but he must also overcome the fierce possessiveness that comes with mating, not to share her with anybody. It is not the Vesti way. His friendship and trust in Liath's dream has been the only thing preventing him from taking her and claiming her as his.Laws of their world prevent them from revealing their true selves to Cyan until she agrees to mate bond with them and return to their home. Bracelets that have been made for Cyan are placed on her wrists. Once this is achieved they go the travel port where they both penetrate her and the bonding ceremony takes place. During the claiming and bonding ceremony Rykken injects Cyan with a mating serum through his fangs, the stones on the bands of Liath and Rykken fill with energy, separate and slide into place on Cyan's bands. Creating the bond that then lets them communicate via the mind and Cyan able to live on their world with them.A great introduction to The Fallen series.",An introduction to The Fallon Mates series
1712,"Seriously a throwback to the old 1960's-70's Harlequin romances set in Europe. Obnoxious, autocratic male lead, weak thoughtless female who has every intention of standing up to Mr. Obnoxious but her big moments seem to fizzle. The more obnoxious he is towards her, the more she gets drawn in until she falls in love with the jerk. This is more like a case of Stockholm Syndrome.

1716,"... Well maybe not let down as much as disillusioned. I have read about open relationships in other books and have not had a big problem with it...not really my flavour but if it is set up right then it's fine. I think what threw me is it the book opens with Angelo and Cole having sex with Zach going, sure whatever you want. Now, I had just read their book, Angelo and Zach's and there was nothing in that book that sets up the relationship as moving in that direction... If anything it is the opposite. So, overall while I think the book was technically well done I am just feeling disappointed in their relationship now. I think that if the author had prepared the way in the first book it wound not have been so bad ,,but that didn't happen. so this whole open relationship, one sided by the way (Angelo only), just ended them in a sour note for me.",Let down
1717,"This book gets a lot of negative reviews. I read them before I decided to invest nothing in the book except the time to read it. I enjoyed reading it. Had I found anything really poorly done, I would have sent this book right off to the deepest archive as I have sent several books that I could not recommend. But, if you have the time, I recommend reading this book.I think the author is young - no older than 25. I say that partly because I wrote a few short stories similar to this in many ways during the period age 15 to 20 when I was in high school and college. I always thought I would write more when I got old and retired from daily pay-the-bills-type work. I haven't written anything because I have almost decided I don't have anything I want to tell anybody. That's the trouble. This kid has put together a story of youths overcoming adversity that displays plenty of youthful optimism and enthusiasm. That's what kept me turning the pages. That's what you lose when you grow old enough to be a good writer with a lot of wisdom and insight into the human condition!A quick review: Mike is 13 and spending a few weeks at a summer camp near the 7,000 ft mark in the Sierra Mountains of California with about 50 other kids and one counselor. The other kids range from 12 to 16 and the counselor is about 22 with some medical training. There were a bunch of other adult counselors but they left to get more supplies and did not return. The boys do a little scouting, as curious boys will, and discover a fog that surrounds as much of their area as they can see, rising to the 6600 ft level. They see birds and deer run into the fog and hear scary screams as these animals remain in the fog. So they conclude that nobody is going very far for a while. They form a small organization led by Mike, who seems to be the only person concerned with their well fare, to gather and preserve food and to build shelters good enough to last the winter. This all lasts several years as they run into bad guys who rape and kill (forcing the boys and girls to kill them with spears and arrows and a hangman's noose) and they establish a set of rules to cover all problems: for example, no sex before you are 16. They discover other people who are nice and helpful so their shelters and food resources are improved. They even find the US Army, or a small contingent, that is just as stranded as they are. It all turns out well in the end. Eventually, many of them marry and start a new generation that can survive the fog. Even Mike eventually gets married. He marries an Army Sargent whom he meets after you read 96% of the book. When they first meet she keeps saying "" that's Sargent Ann Jenkins to you, Kid!"" But then he stands down a big brown bear facing it with only his spear, and they become romantically involved. (You had to have been there!) 2.5 years later she becomes pregnant.There is a slight flaw in the story. Nowhere in the book do we get a description of this lovely Annie. We know she is big enough and strong enough to pick Mike up off his toes grabbing his shirt. But we don't know if she is dark haired or light haired, medium tall or very tall, skinny or fat .... What does Annie look like?","Surviving ""Surviving the Fog"""

1722,"Torn by Christina Brunkhorst is a wonderful romance with an interracial vibe. Ms. Brunkhorst provides the reader with a love story so real, you feel as though you are a part of the drama. The  key setting is in Montana, Big Sky country in all of its majesty.  I related to the small town feel after spending two summers in Missoula, Montana.  Her main character, Chelesa also spent a week in Montana and hence the beginning her a romance with her husband. They make a loving and beautiful family. I loved all of the characters. Ms. Brunkhorst invents them as if she were a supreme being molding and shaping them. Her rich vocabulary and smooth writing style draws in a reader who enjoys utilizing their critical and logical thinking skills. Torn touches all five senses. The love scene may leave you breathless and it did me. Jake, Chelsea's kind-hearted husband is almost a perfect human being. Tyler Benson is awesome in mind, body and soul. Ms. Brunkhorst's secondary characters are as important as the main characters because of their reactions to the events as the story unfolds. These incidents captivate and shake up situations, making the rising action so meaningful. I love the manner in which Ms. Burkhorst inserts drama on top of drama but with flair and lacking confusion and many surprises that touch everyone in Torn in a powerful way. Torn's great ending placed a smile on my face and an indelible mark on my heart. Ms. Burkhorst is a writer to watch and I am a new fan. In my honest opinion, Torn is a terrific book and worth the seven years it took Ms. Burkhorst to concoct such an entertaining, engrossing tale.Ms. Brunkhorst, thanks for making this week-end a peaceful, relaxing one with this book.",Torn

His penchant for getting himself into trouble combined with being a total klutz makes this character completely lovable. There are other characters that you fall in love with as well: Grammy, Laine's grandmother, Cole (Dev's best friend) and Cole's mate, Caroline, who, like Laine, has a penchant for getting into trouble and is a complete and total klutz. This story is short yet sweet that I truly enjoyed reading. Laine keeps Dev on his toes with his shenanigans which will keep you giggling throughout the story.

1727,"I have downloaded this ebook a while back along with many others. Just now got to reading it. I just could not wrap my head around the first few pages! I love to read all types of stories, however this one confuses me from the start. The first person viewpoint is even more confusing. Hard for me to keep track on which is speaking and where it ends. I wouldn't mind a little bit more detail and especially the thrills except- there is only a crumble to none at all. I would have loved the author to make some changes, add some more descriptive and help us &#8211; the readers- identify who is actually talking and when. Also to show if it is a thought and not continued conversation &#8211; which if I had the actual book in hand- want to throw it to the wall.Linda caught cheating &#8211; then dies but is not &#8211; but the conversation &#8211; ugghhh so irritating to read from the get go. Once I am irritated- that is it.Overall, if you are the type of person who is rushed and loves to confuse everyone &#8211; then this one is for you.

The way the story is told with mostly dialogue and inner dialogue made it very hard for me to stay interested. The plot was not well thought out or even believable. I get that this is fiction but it still has to have a realistic plot. Roxanne manages to write books, covert them to screen plays, has her son, and wins best actress awards all in the span of four years.  Um...yeah not realistic.I did not connect or like any of the characters in this book, at all. The two main characters Roxy and Frankie are selfish, immature, and over-dramatic.  I'm sorry but selfish, immature and over-dramatic does not equate to damaged.  The writing was choppy and did not flow well, lacking in detail for the setting and characters. Possibly one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.",Disappointing

Then the whole spaceship thing threw me off too. Like I said I enjoyed the book but it made me shake my head occasionally when he went way out and threw things in that would not be possible. I enjoy Sci-Fi, I enjoy post apocalyptic, I enjoy military thrillers but this was too much to throw in one story line.

Also, keep in mind that the sex described is fiction, as anyone combining all the elements described in this afternoon of sex would not only wind up with a raging yeast infection, but a bacterial one as well, and that's if they were lucky. If not so lucky, there would also be the possibility of a trip to the emergency room.

After their death there is no way out for Annie until her trust funds run dry and there is no-one to pay the doctors bills.  Now alone and on the streets Annie has to find a way to survive. After being attacked she meets Maxwell, a vampire and it's not long before the reason for her visions is revealed.......I have recently read a couple of short story compilations by Alex and enjoyed her writing style so had high hopes for this book but was sadly let down. The writing style was totally different in this full length novel than it was in the short stories and I couldn't get to grips with it. The dialogue was unnatural and it made the characters voice irritate me.The story line was an odd one, initially I was grabbed and I couldn't put it down. Annie who had been in a mental institution for years was suddenly on her own on the streets with very little money.  Then she is attacked and rescued by a helpful stranger. After being unconscious for a few days she wakes up in a strange bed in a strange house.......Now this is where it began to lose me.......... She wakes up in a bed and has no idea how she got there, she decides to look around and finds she is alone in a very well furnished but `looks like it's not lived-in' house. She recalls being attacked so surely she would at that point run for the hills before whoever brought her there (maybe the attacker for all she knows) comes back...........But no!!! she looks around and decides she's going to squat there, clean it up and make it her home!!......It made no sense to me...... why would she do that??? Another point that made me go `ugh' was that the place was filled with antiques and even though she's been locked up for years and is still quite a young girl (I can't remember her age) she could spot a `Queen Anne desk' and a `Louis XIV Chaise'! I'm sorry but being able to tell the difference between crystal vases and glass vases or identify antique furniture is not something she could feasibly be able to do from the life she has endured up to now.After that it was a downward spiral for me, I tried my hardest to convince myself the plot was going to improve, I really wanted it to, but it didn't. At the point Annie transformed into Margaret  Ann I was lost and only continued to read because I will always finish a book I'm asked to review.

1747,I like reading science fiction and I did want to try reading science fiction erotica so this was my first attempt at reading anything like this.  I was not overly impressed or cared that much for this book.  The story and sample sounded interesting of a women geneticist Andrea and a doctor Roark being taken by somone named Mal Ton attempting to save his world I think that is what the story was supposed to be about and something I might like. Throughout the whole book it seemed that the story was just sex and there really wasn't a story involved.  I attempted to try to understand the story after rereading it but it was just a porno with no plot.  I think it would have been easier to just watch it on cinemax then read about it.,Review on Seducer (Sensual Captivity book one)

1750,"I enjoyed the story and David's parallel story lines were easy to follow.  However, it was clear that he has little &#34;real&#34; experience in shipboard life or with military structure and command personalities.  All of his characters are exagerated stereotypes and the interpersonal exchanges would have resulted in few of these protagonists ever reaching command because of the obvious psycholoogical abberations present.One sure indicator of his unfamiliarity with naval (spaceship or surfaceship) life is his lubberly use of &#34;the&#34; before ship names.  We who have spent many years and many deck watches know that a manned ship is truly a living entity, christened at its birth (launching), and possessing the nature and personality of its officers and crew.  Use of &#34;the&#34; before its given name is akin to referring to this book's author as &#34;the David Derrico.&#34;Also, as Isaac Azimov pointed out repeatedly, good science fiction must be good science.  I was appalled when the good Admiral referred to &#34;a new element&#34; as part of the alien hull.  Any &#34;new element&#34; in this universe would necessarily be very unstable with a half life measured in nano-seconds so can't be fairly used withhout first laying the appropriate background work.

1755,"I agree with some of the other reviewers of this book in that I believe the race card is played alittle too strongly.  I believe that unfortuantely, there still is racism in this country and I understand that is what the author was trying to convey.  My issue was mostly with the parts of the book where the author decided to add in the main character, Will Pruett, a young black reporter's, thoughts throughout the book.  We get that he is black but he is an educated man who does not speak like a 13 year old street person at any other point in the book so stop trying to make him think in a completely different tone of voice than he actually speaks.  It seemed the author was trying to ram down our throats that he was black by adding these thought bubbles in and it was completely distracting and unnecessary.  You can't make him 2 different people, he is either an educated man who happens to be black or he is the disgusting stereotype of an uneducated black man who cannot speak proper english, pick one.  Other than that, the second half of the story was really good.  I was interested in the story line and the second half definitely had a twist I was not necessarily expecting which I enjoyed.  It kept me hooked all the way to the end to find out how the story would be resolved.  Overall good book and good story line but there was just a lot of unnecessary stuff in the first half I could have done without.","Good, not great"

1759,"If you've come down this far in the reviews, then I hope you'll finish reading.  I hope you'll also note the publisher's review that implies very mild BDSM and lots and lots of sex.  Don't download this book if you're gonna have a problem with sex on a first date, explicit sexual language and graphic descriptions of sex or people having, you know, sex.To call this a PNR is a stretch because it's way too erotic to be a romance.  And apparently it's not erotic enough to be called erotica for some picky people.  If the rest of the story is only a conveyance to get the couple in bed, in my mind that's erotica even if it's tame.Okay, so now if you're still interested, please get this book!  You won't be disappointed.  This is a straightforward story with a very simple plot.  It's not superior storytelling; I would have liked more character development on both sides, and the dialogue is not great.  But, ultimately, I read erotica so I can get jazzed up and go jump my husband; this book definitely, erm, scored in that regard.  I hate contrived drama between the male and female who could clear everything up if they only talked about their feelings or asked the right question.  The couple in this story had a problem and voila, they talked about it so they could move on to the good part.  What a concept.So, yes, the sex, there's a lot of it.  Just because nobody gets a ball gag in their mouth doesn't mean it's not hot.  The couple connected, had chemistry and the scene where she's doing the monster, holy smoke... well done.",Fun Erotic Read

1762,"This is a short story that takes place BEFORE the rest of the series.I downloaded this after reading all of the negative comments about it, and I can honestly say that (for once) I understand WHY this got a generally negative review.There were very few times that I laughed. Considering that this is supposed to be a humorous short story, I was a bit let down.I am not one to complain about profanity, and I assure you, there is a lot of it from all the characters. I wasn't upset with that. I was, however, upset with the flip-flopping of perspectives which was not done effectively in this short story.Because I followed every characters emotions, I wasn't really able to connect with any one of them.What stopped me from giving this a ""one"" was the ending that I did not see coming. It was just so utterly shocking that I had no idea how to react to it. I guess that was what the author was going for in the end...I just had higher hopes for this.",Is This REALLY Part of a Series?

1766,"There is not much I can write that isn't written in other reviews, other then the fact I don't write reviews.  In fact this is my first.  The story is indeed different.  It is indeed in need of an editor, however this has not something that has bothered me with self published titles on Amazon to this point.  I would say that while the action starts quick enough, it feels disjointed and the sequences just do not feel like they are in the right order.  The writing was to a point where I just couldn't finish it.  I think it may help the43 author to go through and restructure the story.  It feels like the writing was done without any real overall plan and not gone through afterward to check for grammar mistakes or a smooth reading story.",Needs a rewrite
1767,"If I had known that 93% was technically 100% of this book I could have finished this last night. I should have stuck with it even though I was ready for bed. Either way I'm done and I'm so glad I didn't pay anything for this book. I don't think I've read a book that uses the ""F"" word as frequently as this book. And I know I've read alot of books that don't refrain from using it or other choice words.Anyways the idea of the story isn't terrible but I didn't like any of the characters all that much. Everything happened really quickly which it had to since this was a short story. The humorous thing was that Linda the woman that is dead(ish) hung around looking for her body and she was constantly screwing around with her ex-boyfriend/murderer. She was not a great character but once in a while did something funny. Like choosing Mike's wardrobe for court. That was a nice touch.I'm not going to recommend it to anyone because I'd rather save anyone from the trouble of reading it and dissatisfied as well. Although the book contains an excerpt from (technically)DEAD I will not read any further. I'm not interested in the series.",Another I'm glad was free
1768,"I will read almost anything.  I like romance, erotica, thrillers, humor.  This book wants to be erotic but really it's just sex and the sex isn't that interesting after awhile.  There is no character development, the plot is more than simplistic.Basically, the guy goes into the Tyger version of a heat.  He needs sex and he needs it now.  The spacecraft needs him to pilot so they ask for a volunteer.  A female Tyger from his planet volunteers.So they have sex, domineering sex that gets old after the first two times. He treats her like convenience.  She resents him but wants him. And could the character please stop saying the word pussy. The pun was old after the first 10 times.  The guy gets well enough to pilot, his heat ends, he dumps her, she is broken-hearted.He ends up missing her after all and decides to take her back.  She says yes. The end.Really.  No plot.No depth of character.The male character is unlikable.So that's what I have to say.  This one is a not worth the three dollars.If you like these types of books, read Lora Leigh's Mercury's War, Megan's Mark, Dawn's Reckoning.  Those three are much better than this one.  Want something with more humor?  Read  'When He Was Bad' or 'The Beast In Him' or any of the series by Shelly Laurenston.You want something with more edge?  Read about the Sazi series by C.T. Adams.But don't read this.",Truly Dreadful

1777,"I've read several of Glenn's books over several series. Before reading this volume, I had read every other volume of this series (except the newest 1, vol. 7; it had not been published when I finished reading the other 5). I had not read this one, because I didn't think the books needed to be read in sequence and the summary for this one just didn't interest me enough to want to read it. Since I thought 7 costs more than what I wanted to pay, and I'd been waiting for several months, a year at least I think, for her to finish the series, because vol. 6 actually ended with a cliff hanger - I decided to just go ahead and read this volume for the sake of completion, in the mean time while waiting for the price of vol. 7 to lower, if it lowers.Well after reading vol. 1, I wish that I hadn't, but I'd been curious about how Jake and Lucas got together with Leyland, because all the others manage to refer to their relationship and the 'incident' that they had with Leyland where he almost died, at least once. Since the first vol. of the series, that I did read, explained the issue with the tri-omegas having to find their 2nd mate, once they found the first, I could deduce why or how it was the Leyland nearly died from being grounded to his room for several days. Therefore, I didn't think that the actual circumstances that led to the grounding, but just what nearly happened as a result of the grounding, was pertinent to the plots of the other volumes. In conclusion, I didn't need to read it to fully understand any of the vols. that I did read, if I didn't want to.I tried to like Secret Desires, after one read, but I just couldn't, not enough to want to keep it or suggest it to anyone else. I liked it from the very beginning, when no one other than Leyland had been introduced. I found it amusing, but then Jake was introduced, but not Lucas. And I started to wonder why Jake greeted Leyland alone without Lucas. I knew that Jake and Lucas had been together 10 years for the summary. I assumed that the summary meant mated. It didn't. And when I figured that out, I got rather disappointed with the story. I couldn't understand how Jake and Lucas after being in love with and sleeping with one another and sharing a bedroom for TEN YEARS, didn't realize that one another was mates, despite the fact that they really, really didn't believe two men could be mated, if after seeing - not touching or actually meeting - but just seeing Leyland ONCE, only once, Jake knew without a doubt that Leyland was definitely his mate, since Leyland was ALSO A MAN. I'm not sure how the author didn't see that glaring contradiction in her own work. A good friend of mine, suggested that it's probably due to not having an editor, because that's the sort of things editors catch and bring to the author's attention, before she publishes a work.The three of them Jake, Luc and Ley got things sorted rather quickly and that was good.The gaping contradiction, was just too hard for me to ignore, and that's the not so good part. Now if you have read any of the others, like vol. 2 and 3 which have the same contradiction and 4, which is the exact opposite, where the two regular wolves are mated before they meet the tri-omega and then one of them recognized the tri-omega as his mate upon the first time he met him, but the other didn't. (The 2nd one was drunk, and furious due to major jealously at the time, plus tired and sleepy, so maybe that was his excuse. Can't say, because the author never explains.) I was able to let it slide in the 2 and 3, because, in those cases, the tri-omegas 2 mates had not met and been involved before meeting him. Instead, one met the tri-omega first and got involved and then the two of them both met the third and pretty much the same time and together. So it was easier to ignore.I just couldn't get over how Jake could drop the love of his life for 10 years, for someone he'd never actually met, and then have sex with the guy - Leyland - on the way back to the house that he shared with said long-time lover. Really?!! And then when Jake and Leyland get to the house, and Lucas realizes that Leyland is his mate too, Jake immediately doesn't want to share. So first, he breaks up with Lucas, taking himself as a lover from Luc and two, when he learns that Luc actually has a fated mate, same as he does, because it just happens to be his also, he doesn't want Luc to claim the guy right away, like he just did, until HE can figure things out. So while Jake has everything including something he's always dreamed of, but never thought would happen - his fated mate,Leyland, plus Luc pining over him, poor Luc, on the other hand, has NO ONE and nothing, just immense, nearly unbearable pain and suffering, while 'Jake' figures things out. And to add insult to injury, Jake gets to have his mate 'while' he figures thing out and Luc gets to live in the same house and watch and listen to the man that he loves 'and' his mate, be with one another while he's alone and can't be with either, nor even claim his mate, Leyland, whom he has just as much right to as Jake dose - while 'Jake' figures things out.  I liked Jake; he seemed to be a good guy for the most part, but I thought in his excitement of having a mate and his rush to claim him, Jake's behavior toward Luc, the man he'd loved for 10 years, was greedy, selfish and insensitive. I don't think finding his fated mate, was a good enough reason for him to just go off and claim the guy in the way that he did, with the sex, before giving poor Luc any chance to even try to adjust. Haven't they heard of dating!! He could have just tried to get to know Leyland first, for awhile without him even being at the house or living there at least, without claiming him, while giving Luc some time to try and wrap his mind around the whole thing. But no, after only being broke up for only a few weeks, not even a month, he moves another man - fated mate or not - into the room that he had shared with Luc while Luc is still living in the same house! Really?! That was awful!!!! In my opinion it was. Fate or not, there is a right way and a wrong way to do a thing. And that was not right way. To me the author comes across saying that their love for anyone else, means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, when compared to being with their fated mate. Yes, everything worked out in the end, but neither Jake and especially not Luc knew that.Jake gets his mate, great and wonderful, and Luc just gets shafted and not in the good way. And Jake couldn't find a way to be more sensitive about it. I don't see that a fated mate allows them to just disregard someone that hey are currently involved with.I had wondered what one of them, a shifter, would do in a situation like that where, he/she met their mate, but was already in loving monogomous relationship with someone, that he/she had been with for a long time, at the time.  When I finally read an example, though, - I really didn't like it! Well sometimes, that's how it is.Yeah, I know it's fantasy, but I take love very seriously. So I don't like it, when a character in a story, is supposed to be the good-guy or the protagonist, and just treats someone they love horribly for any reason, other than to save a person's life or to like save the world (family, town, country, universe, space and time and we know it) or something of that nature.","Not the Worse, But Not the Best"
1778,"Although the kids sat still for this, I would have liked to have more illustrations. Overall, it was an okay book.",Okay
1779,"This is one of the most ridiculous books that I have ever read.  It doesn't seem as if the author understood very much about the way the world works at all.  One of the main characters became a lawyer right after graduating college (it doesn't seem as if the author knows about the existence of law school) and another main character is given full scholarships and acceptance letters from two different colleges from a high school teacher without even applying to either college.  The mechanics of adoption are also presented really fuzzily.  There are open adoptions available -- it doesn't have to be the way the author presented it.  You also just can't terminate a father's parental rights without giving a child up for adoption -- but I guess a lawyer who didn't go to law school can't be expected to challenge that.Aside from the facepalm-worthy factual errors, this book is just tedious to read.  Shawna is so thoughtless and dumb that she brings the vast majority of her problems upon herself.  The other characters are just like cardboard cutouts surrounding her.  Conrad and his mother are too evil to be believed and the various friends that Shawna makes along the way are just too good to be true while also inexplicably falling by the wayside when she actually needs help.Nobody really talks or acts like a real person.  It was unclear why Conrad wanted a family so much and why he had to have a sixteen-year-old as his girlfriend.  It was also unclear why Shawna would go along with this when she love him so little that she fell for the first guy who asked her out on a lunch date.Everything about this book is purely ridiculous.  Even if the editing issues were fixed, it isn't like reading a book set in the real world.  I would only recommend this for hardcore readers of woe-is-me fiction who will accept a massively unrealistic tacked-on happy ending.  Everyone else should avoid.",Ridiculous

When a person is forced to grow up faster, than they should for their age and face reality that is exactly what Laura and Caleb did. Caleb was an okay hero. What I disliked about him was that had been with whores. That is just disgusting on so many levels. I get that in romance novels guys aren't suppose to be virgins and women have to be virgins or have been with a least one man, but sleeping with whores takes it to another level. What I did like abut him is that protected Laura and her son, Robbie. Would I recommend his book to anyone? No. Would I read it again? No. It is an okay book to read if you 're bored.

She had trouble being around strangers, but couldn't be around men at all.  She was working out with Lacey at the gym when she had a panic attack, and was mortified that Lacey's brother Blade Vaughn was there to witness it.

Lacey stepped in and helped her get away without any more additional trauma.Blade had wanted Candy for longer than he cared to remember.  He didn't know her well, but had wanted to remedy that situation.  He thought he might have an opportunity at the gym, but after her episode, it was impossible.  When he asked Lacey what had caused her severe reaction, she was completely tight lipped, and told him to ask her himself.  Blade couldn't let it go, and when he found himself at her home for the first time, he wasn't sorry he was there, but only sorry for the circumstance.  He could see instantly that she was beyond uncomfortable with his spontaneous visit.  After some coaxing, he finally got her to confide in him.  Blade had never been so horrified or angry after hearing her story.  He couldn't believe someone would take advantage of someone as beautiful as Candy.  It took some persuading, but he convinced her to give him, and them a chance.Candy has lots of baggage, and emotional trauma to overcome, but what a great guy she has in Blade to help her over any hurdles.

His dialogue was peppered with ""Fo'rizzy,"" ""Foshizzle,"" ""My nizzle, no diggity,"" among others. No exaggeration. Seriously, NO ONE talks like that. Unless they're impersonating Snoop Dogg on SNL. Outside of that, the setting descriptions were incredibly detailed, the police protocols were completely on point (I think one of the authors was a cop), and the story geared up for an amazing twist.

1795,"I read books not only because I love to read about new characters and their adventures, but also because I want to write. I am currently hard at work on the fourth rewrite of my manuscript, and some of the best places I look to for inspiration are other books. Seeing how the author flows the action, how they make the characters come alive, how they draw me in, gives me fresh ideas on how to make my own writing better. So when I read and review novels, I am not just reviewing as a reader, but also as a writer. I just wanted to add that little disclaimer before I get into my next review.Sammi Ever After, the debut novel from Soma Helmi has a great plot. Sammi, a young girl in her twenties, finds a friend from childhood and instantly falls in love, preparing to move across the world just to be with him. It's her fairy tale come true. Until she arrives at the airport only to find out she has been dumped- over an email. Fairy tale broken. When Sammi finally forces herself off her friend's couch and secures a job and new friends, she decides to take a little journey to try to search for that fairy tale ending. From London to Bali to Greece, Sammi gets tangled in sticky situations and personal revelations, and realizes that her Prince Charming may have been by her side the entire time.Like I said, I think the plot is fantastic. A great story about self-discovery and love, and I am a huge travel geek, so reading about all these destinations I hope to visit had me amped to read this story. But once I started, the writing fell flat to me. Helmi relied on flashbacks and back story when introducing characters, much that was simply not needed and unnecessary to the story. For each flashback, I felt myself became less engaged in the action. Another problem I had was the dialogue didn't seem very realistic. I don't know anyone who would actually describe someone's look aloud by saying ""His sandy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes and the way his muscles ripple..."" That could be the thoughts of someone, but for a person (especially a young girl) to describe someone else that way? It just wasn't believable for me. So as much as I would have liked this plot and the characters that came along for the ride, I do not feel the writing did the story justice.",Sammi Ever After

1799,"Ok, the basic plot just reminds me of a harlequin romance except between two men... At this point I expected more than a pink hearts story... If I had to say whether I would buy it again, I would not, but just because I want more depth of character. I like well-rounded characters and these just felt a little two dimensional.","Okay, but I felt something was missing..."
1800,"I often have to reset my brain during the first chapter or two of books that are new worlds, and this was the same. The story started strong though and was definitely worth the effort. I had to remind myself that in the age and place of Nicole's world, children grow up a lot faster than my four. They have a maturity necessary for the hardships they will face.Aislinn came off strong and determined from the very beginning. I loved that she knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to go after it even though it was not the accepted norm for her country. Many times she was so stubbornly focused on her goal that she missed or ignored certain aspects of a child's life. This was one of the things that made her so real to me. I could relate to that stubborn focus.I also loved how she matured over the years. One of my favorite scenes is when she breaks down in tears over the death of a young girl. It is a great moment when you realize what a caring woman she has grown into on top of her strength as a knight in training. The balance and realism is expertly crafted. A true example of how to show who your character is and not telling.There is also a sweet romance woven through this book. I didn't feel like it was the main focus, but the back and forth between these characters is so natural you can't help but be swept away by it. When it looks like there is no way they can ever be together, you ache with Aislinn.All in all, I really enjoyed this read and can't wait for life to slow down so I can read the  next two books in the series.",A girl who knows what she wants and goes for it.
1801,"Perhaps its unfair for me to rate a book after only reading about 20 pages but frankly I felt like I was reading a 5th grade essay. It was dull, nothing special with extremely basic grammar. With so many great books out there, a book really has to reel me in from the get go. There is no need to hang in there for 3 or 4 chapters to see if things pick up, you pretty much know from the start. The author either has 'it' or they don't.",booooooorrrrrrriiiiiinnnng

1803,"This is the fifth book in the original six book Lost Fleet series.  I consider this to be the best Space Opera series which I have read.  After 4 books of tactical genius and reasoned risks, Captain Geary and the Alliance Fleet are within a handful of jumps to Alliance space.  Captain Geary struggles as the risks seem more tangible as their final destination seems so close.  Fleet opponents become more desperate as they realize that there is little time to displace Captain Geary.  The Syndics are not content to be counted out and still have some cards to play on the seemingly invincible Alliance fleet.  Many plot lines come to epic conclusion in this book which I find has the best ending of any of the books in the original Lost Fleet series.Each book builds on the previous so it is important to read the books in order.  The first Lost Fleet Series consists ofThe Lost Fleet: Dauntless,The Lost Fleet: Fearless,The Lost Fleet: Courageous,The Lost Fleet: Valiant,The Lost Fleet: RelentlessandThe Lost Fleet: Victorious.  Author has also started a new series,The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier: Invincible, in the same universe.The Lost Fleet: Relentless is 4,548 Kindle locations long.  Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range.  Longer novels can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.",Awesome!
1804,this story was published in another book.  it is available at the public library.  if the price was 99 cents i would say buy it and avoid the trip to the library. it is not worth $3.99.  But it is a good stand alone story.,get it at the library

1807,"I am so disappointed in this book. The over all idea was awesome, the execution however fell far too short. Horrible grammar abounds. The book changes tense over and over. The dialogue was forced as was the awkward relationship between the characters.One minute the leading man thinks the leading woman is a gold digging whatever and the next he is jumping her bones (a complete stranger to him mind you). It's like someone took all the cliches they ever read in a romance novel and strung them all together and called it a story. I won't read anything by this author again, It was just sloppy, lazy writing. So bad I could not make myself finish the story.",Never again

1810,"Kaya is a shifter and has spent most of her entire life alone.  When she sees the men at a cabin in her neck of the woods, she is curious.  Daily she watches these men come and go until hurt, she goes to them for comfort the only way she knows how, as a cougar.Having seen `their' cougar for days without the pretty feline coming any closer, Jericho and Hunter are surprised when she finally gets close enough to them for them to touch her.  Realizing she is exhausted and hurt, they bring her inside.  Hours later, both men are surprised to find their cougar has vanished and a naked and beautiful but skittish woman seems to have appeared from thin air.  They have no idea the woman they are seeing is the cougar they have been slipping food to for months.Kaya has never trusted another person before - not to mention two people. She has loved both men for so long that all she wants to do is be close to them.  They seem to feel the same way and when they are asked to finish one mission for the government, they hesitate to leave Kaya alone but she accepts their promises to return.Amber Eyes made me cry more than once.  Not only cry - I sobbed out loud.  What a beautiful love story Maya Banks has released.  With an innocence air, Amber Eyes is just an amazing tale of love and trust.  Kaya is a victim of her surroundings almost.  She ran away from kidnappers early in her life and pretty much grew up on her own.  She didn't rely on anyone for anything - until Hunter and Jericho.  The love these men showed Kaya more than once made me swoon and sigh at the gentleness of their touches and the love the three shared.Amber Eyes highlights what Maya Banks does best - she grabs her reader by the heart and doesn't let go.  Emotionally gripping with smoldering passions, Amber Eyes is a must read.  I joyfully recommend it!TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Amber Eyes-A Joyfully Recommended Title
1811,"In the hands of a gifted writer, this original ghost story could have been hilariously entertaining.  With this writer, not so much.  As other reviewers have said, this reads like a very sketchy description of a book, rather than the book itself. None of the characters are believable or relatable, the plot lurches along without much sense or description and, oh yeah, there is a lot of gratuitous vulgar language. I am very glad that I downloaded this for free from Amazon's lineup and did not spend actual money on it. Thankfully, this was a a short read; but it really is not worth the effort.",Slightly Funny (ish)
1812,"The elements of this story showed off the the author's individual flare.  Rather than a run-of-the-mill nonhuman romance, she creates a cool world where shifters practice magic and potion-making and the rules of shifter society create real conflict for the hero, Lucas.  The heroine, Nita, has a lot of depth; she deals with avoiding life by sticking to her routine, something a lot people are guilty of.  Lucas makes some errors in judgment that have real consequences and those errors make him a plausible character.The love scenes aren't terribly memorable and the villain is dull, trite, and unworthy of the main characters.  Also, it would have been great to see some the pack's prejudice rather than just take the characters' word for it.  Despite these setbacks ""City Wolf 2"" was definitely worth the read.",A Unique Tale

It is the story about what happens between Leslie, Niall, and Irial after the events that occur in ""Ink Exchange"".  The story is so-so.  Not a horrible read but nothing to write home about.Part 1 is a total cliffhanger, so download Part 2 at the same time so you can read it right away.  It's a very quick read; Part 1 takes maybe 20 minutes to read.Overall, it was something to read.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't enjoy it that much either.  So it gets an okay from me.

I read the first book next, and am now reading the third in the series.

Phoebe was easy to love. She was incredibly strong when faced with much travail.I am giving the book 5 stars in spite of the transcription errors. It is that good.

1823,"This story sounded good to me. I eagerly downloaded it for free. Now I've finally finished, I'm glad I didn't pay anything for it.I was pulled in at the start, thinking this might turn out to be a 4 star book. The writing style took a little getting used to. Much of it seemed old-fashioned, but since the story started out in 1924, I was willing to go with that. The basic premise of unrequited love, a marriage of convenience, and an ambitious young man battling the odds kept me reading. Initially, the author did a fairly good job with an omniscient POV, which is generally difficult to pull off. Though this tended to keep all the characters distant, and I never felt much of a connection to any of them.And there are A LOT of them. This is not a book to put down and take up again next day. I tried this, and found I had lost track of who was who. But it's too long a book to read in one sitting, so I resigned myself to jotting notes. Ug.The heavy used of the passive voice made many scenes pass by as if it were all happening behind a scrim, or out of focus.Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the negatives in this book outweighed the positives.Positive: I wanted to find out what happened to the families.Negatives: Most of the characters are completely unsympathetic. The few I came to like had something horrible happen to them. Almost everyone is just mean and vindictive to each other. I kept waiting for good to win out, but it never does. There is nothing satisfying about the abrupt and ambiguous ending. I was left with the feeling that I slogged through all that nastiness of human nature with nothing at all to feel good about. Oh, and after years of loathing and contempt, turns out that was really just magnetic attraction in disguise? Yay, another dysfunctional partnership in the making. Wonderful.Remember that omniscient POV I mentioned? Well, it dissolved into distracting head-hopping. I'm pretty sure this story could have been told effectively without knowing the thoughts of every person in the scene, always.Often, the author was not content to show us fits of rage, but then felt the need to tell us the character was enraged. Yeah, I got that.Overall, I have to say the author didn't have quite the skills to manage this bakery. The writing was amateurish in many places. This confection--a dry doughnut with just a smidgen of cream filling to entice--ended up giving me indigestion.",Unstisfying
1824,"This is a touching look at a family dealing with a parent/grandparent with Alzheimers.  It is seen through the eyes of the grandson who must share his room with his ailing grandfather.

1826,"This book is apparently part of a trilogy(Red Hot Summer)that you can purchase all together. I am not fond of stories were the girl has to excessively chase the guy, but it was a nice change, and the guy did some chasing of his own in the end. The steamy scenes were hot enough and the emotion was there, but there was a lack of description about the characters features. I still don't know what color hair or eyes they had?

1833,"I thought this had the makings of a fairly good fantasy book.  It's probably closer to 3.5/3.75 stars but I had to round up on this one.  As someone previously mentioned this book can be read as a stand-alone and while it does get a bit rushed in certain parts, I appreciated that it didn't cut off mid-story and look for a second or third book.  (Although there are additional books which continue with other adventures.)A few good things:I enjoyed seeing some new races that I hadn't really read about previously, Algors and Delvers.  It would be good to have a better understanding of the Algors and what gives them almost a hive mentality while still trying to be individuals.  More insight in to what makes the Delvers a separate race when they pretty much mix in and breed with humans.  At this point all we see is that there aren't many (for that reason) and they move very quickly.The characters, most of the time, are pretty believable and there is no one character that suddenly gains godly powers or anything.  They all have abilities but not anything over the top.Over all a pretty smooth read, it started a bit slow but then picked up and had enough action to hold my interest throughout the story.A few bad:The basic story was a bit simple and pretty much followed the standard format of the group of various races/traits coming together on their journey to overcome the evil threatening the world.  So it wasn't at times very much like reading a shorter/modified version of Lord of the Rings.  They were even heading to an old dormant volcano / mountain in the end.At times the characters were a bit on noted.  Ryson, the Delver was always a goodie two shoes and would never hurt anyone, even if it meant putting others in danger.  IE: he catches the bad/evil creatures and lets them go, or just knocks them out.  He doesn't even want to ""kill"" some animated sandstone creatures until he's assured that they're not really alive.  It seemed a bit like he was too altruistic or pure/innocent.  It almost made it a bit hard to identify with him as a character for me.  The elves, especially Lief was at time annoying with his quick jumps to argument and yelling.. and of course Ryson pretty much always ignored it or tried to calm him down even though he was usually the target or Lief's over reactions.  The others had similar problems.Maybe it was intentional but there seemed to be a bit of a religious theme thrown in there towards the end with ""Godson"" everywhere and some ""angels"" in the end of the story.  I didn't really see any purpose in that and for me, it didn't really add much of anything to the story.  Also, seemed that there was a very big separation between good characters being completely good and the bad being basically pure evil no real characters in the gray middle area, which could have made things a bit more interesting.Over All:While not in any way an Epic Fantasy Book, but it was a very good light read.  It kept things clean and simple and is something you could easily let younger teens/kids read without any worries.  It was a good standalone book with subsequent books available that involve the characters/groups in different adventures so you can stop with this one or continue if you enjoy it.  I'd suggest this book to anyone who likes the high fantasy style and just wants a fairly easy read.",Pretty Good Fantasy

Princess Robin is the secret child of King Richard and she is known throughout the land as Princess Robin whom steals from the Rich and Gives to the Poor with her band of merry boys.Princess Robin is raised as a wild child and has no desires to fulfill her duties as a woman of her time.  Sir Simon takes every opportunity to teaser her, bate her and make her as angry as possible. Sir Simon is a Knight of King Richard and is trying to save King Richards true love from marring the fat Prince John. Robin and Simon are thrown together into a light and fun adventures that takes them from the Sherwood forest, though swampy mash lands, mountains so high and back down to Nottingham, looking for an artifact that will keep Lady Marion from marrying Prince John.  Robin falls in love with Simon over the course of their adventures because she realizes that he isn't what he seems.  Their romance blossoms and the author gives the reader a reminder of their first love, however there are several sex scenes in the book while not graphic I wouldn't want my young teen or teen reading the book.  I wish the author had created more of an adventure and less romance throughout the book, but that is only my opinion because I enjoy a good adventure and less romance.  I will however admit I did giggle like a school girl while reading the book several times.I also wish the author made Robin more physically strong and able to take care of herself and less I fallen and I can't get up.  Several times Robin talks about being able to take care of herself or knowing where she was going but instead she is lost or falling into quicksand or off the side of a mountain.  I feel it would have made Robin a bit more believable as a thief, the leader of robbers, if she was able to take care of herself.  I read this book remembering it is a self -published young adult novel and while it isn't going to win Pulitzer prize I think the author gave a fun take on a very old story.  It is a love story for the young adult who might not be ready for a strong adult romance but do not want to be stuck reading Disney romance story either.The author took lot of liberty in her choices of history, landscape and language used but at the same time it was an enjoyable teen\twenty something novel.

Will they find a way to balance the two or is it already too late to rectify the wrongs they've done to Cat?If you think being in a menage a trois relationship means that you'd never feel neglected or taken for granted then you're wrong.  In Maya Banks STAY WITH ME, Cat, Logan and Rhys are forced to face the fact they're all to blame for the break down in their marriage.  Cat's been too compliant and never voiced her unhappiness.  Logan and Rhys are so career driven that they didn't realize that they were hurting her by not being more attentive.  If their marriage is going to succeed they're all going to have to put each other first, but can the men really delegate their business to office hours only?Maya Banks has become one of my favorite authors because of her emotionally driven storylines.  In STAY WITH ME readers will be drawn into the story and come to really care about the characters and maybe even live vicariously through them.  Who wouldn't like to have two sexy men doing everything in their power to make sure you don't leave them?  This is a wonderful story that I'll definitely be adding to the keeper shelf - along with the rest of Ms. Banks' books.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies
1853,Dr. Thorndyke is truely a fantastic legal eagle combined with a medical doctor.

Anyway, this book is basically all sex, and sex, and more sex.  Not much of a story in between.  I like some erotic scenes, but I am saying this book was just ALL those kind of scenes.  It was just too much sex, and not enough story.  Not at all realistic as far as how things ended up either.  Skip this one!",Really kind of terrible....

1877,"A retired police chief is asked to help out In a murder investigation. I really enjoyed the set up of the main characters, retired police chief, living with a gay friend and working with the local police force on a consultancy basis. The reason I gave this four stars is because it would seem very unlikely that a civilian, albeit a retired police chief would be given such a free hand. Practically running the investigation on his own. Then when he finds peadophile  tapes he does not think this has much bearing on the case, but is looking for an unhappy house buyer??

1881,"Book 1:  Men in Love seriesOn the run from her stepfather, Jenny Barnes wakes up in hospital to find the two men she's loved for years are with her. Her stepbrother, Jake, and his best friend and lover, Cree, have finally been called to her side after they spent years searching for her. But when they take Jenny home to their new ranch, even they can't keep her tormentor away. With the help of their ex-Seal buddies they set out to keep the love of their lives safe and to capture Jake's own father.WARNING:  This review contains spoilers*****************************************************************************************************************I found myself frustrated with this story.  The writing is tight and the storyline amazingly good.  I love the premise and the way the story builds from Jenny passing out on the street after being assaulted by her step-father to her living with her step-brother Jake and his best friend/lover, Cree, while continually being stalked by her step-father.  The characters are likable and come off as real rather than caricatures.What I had a problem with were Jenny's reactions after the abuse she suffered at her step-father's hands.**SPOILER ALERT**  **SPOILER ALERT**  **SPOILER ALERT**  **SPOILER ALERT**I found Jenny's physical reactions after being raped and tortured to be unrealistic.  When Cree surprises her in the kitchen by grabbing her from behind, Jenny's reaction is to 'almost' drop a roast.  Not yell.  Not scream.  Not try to fight.  I would have expected any of those reactions rather than the more mild ""starting"" that actually happened especially after 5 years of being on the run from her step-father.I also found it incredibly unrealistic that Jenny would be able to fight off her step-father while she was still fresh from a gunshot wound to her side.  I might have believed it had the author talked about adrenaline rush and gone on to talk about the pain of reopening a wound.  I also highly doubt that after all of that, Jenny would be in shape to have a wedding after only a week, let alone take a day to go shopping in the big city and have herself waxed 2 days before that.My last complaint concerns the language.  In a few places, I found the characters' conversation to be formal and more like what you would (pardon the pun) read in a book than what real people would say.  This is actually a very mild complaint since it's not through the entire book and really is just in a few places.**END SPOILER ALERT**  **END SPOILER ALERT**  **END SPOILER ALERT**  **END SPOILER ALERT**I gave this story 3 stars because I felt it was middle of the road with the issues I mentioned.  I think a quick re-write would make this a solid 5 star story and it has definitely made me want to check out the next story in the series, ""Ben's Wildflower"".",Branded by Gold

I tend to stay away from time travel books, because I drive myself crazy over-thinking about what's happening/going to happen/never should have happened etc.  This book was listed under romance, but it is much more of a mystery/time travel book and had very little romance in it.

But when his get out of jail free card goes missing, things suddenly become all too real.The plot plods along nicely enough. Underlying issues of racism, bent cops, and steroid abuse play a large part.I was expecting a bit more of an insight into prison life and especially death row. The main character doesn't make any friends inside and spends most of his time sitting in his cell wondering what went wrong, or getting beaten up.The story works and the plot is original and has some twists. The ending wasn't clear to me as to what it was supposed to be implying. Good but not great.",Good but not great...

His boyfriend, Jacob, is also a PsyCop, but he's the non-psychic half of a separate detective team in a different precinct. Vic rates as a level five medium (the scale goes to seven), and he's able to easily hear and see the spirits of the deceased who have not moved on yet. He also has a tendency to abuse his medications, but hey, if you kept seeing murders reenacted, you would too.""Secrets"" is a great read. We delve deeper into Vic like we never have before. His relationship with Jacob is being strained by both internal and external forces. He's being pressured to have a house-warming for his new place, but since he and Jacob aren't officially ""out"" on the force, he starts to more closely contemplate he and Jacob can or will be perceived by their peers. Also, he's come to discover that there's very little information about him on the Internet. None, actually. Someone, or some group, is going through great lengths to erase any mention of him anywhere.The characters are deep and complex. Victor's narration is addictive and compelling (and wittily sarcastic throughout). Romantic encounters are charged with eroticism and passion. This book is a little different from the rest in that it doesn't have as conclusive an ending. The ending is the obvious jumping-off point of the next book in the series, ""Camp Hell"". Being enjoyable in of itself, ""Secrets"" also serves to build great momentum for the conclusion found in ""Camp Hell"", making the two novels combined an incredibly enjoyable and passionate experience.

1896,"The entire time I read this I just wanted to go ick...This book is presented pretty much as a Romance and I just don't like adultery in my Romance. Personally I did not like any of the characters and the ""good"" wife sure shucked her pantaloons quick for a guy with a pretty face and good manners. Perhaps if the author had given the romance portion time to develop slowly instead of the ""oops I couldn't control myself"", I might have been able to enjoy the story more.  Unfortunately, the author kept presenting the wife and lover as people of honour and the husband as a monster and while I believe she did the latter she failed miserably in the former. I also felt as if the ending was a cheat, I knew it was coming but I kept hoping that she would be a little more original.  I am not one of those people who expect the lovers to be virgins or even requiring the lovers to be limited to two of the opposite gender, however I do not like liars and sneaks and that is what this book is full of.",Adultery and Romance not a good mix
1897,"This book was a little slow in the beginning, but once the killing started, I had a hard time putting it down.  The kindle edition is a little rough due to some formatting problems, but it was definitely readable.  Williams does a great job with character definition and more than makes up for what the book lacks in plot.  The author's descriptions of violence are so well done that it is easy to visualize the gory details.  For fans of gratuitous violence, this book does not disappoint!",Really good book if you like violence!
1898,"Why does it seem that so many books regardless of how innocent the cover looks, and the initial description, you end up with pornography????? This was a good enough story to stand on its own, but all the over the top erotica was too much! Not to mention, its extremely unrealistic to have a main character that is supposed to be extremely shy, falling into bed with someone the first night. I don't care whether she's had a crush on the guy or not! Then bringing out the sex toys when everyone should be concerned about the kidnapped family member. Utterly ridiculous!!!! I really liked the dialog between Leo and Ruby, but all the sex went too far for what I thought was a lighthearted romance. From now on I guess I'll have to read more than just 2 or 3 reviews. But that won't be a problem since I won't read anymore of this author's books.",Come on - Really?????
1899,"This is the second book in the Dragon Town Trilogy.  The first book is Snapdragon Alley and the last is Dragon Town.  In this book, Argus, the 3-year-old from the first book, is a 22 year old man with a quiet life.  He is quiet and depressed, estranged from his family, an lives with a group of roommates that he doesn't really interact with.  He doesn't remember the experiences of the summer that took place in the first book.  One day, he is handed a mysterious package.  Those around him are intrigued, and everyone joins together to try to solve the clues.The tone of the book is fairly dark, and you keep hoping for a better 'Happily ever After' for the characters from the first book than is portrayed here.  But this is only the second book in the series - perhaps there is more to come.In writing about a book series that Argus is reading, this author writes ""They were genuine mystery novels, where the mystery often remains mysterious, unlike most books of that type, which should really be called 'solution' novels because there is rarely any mystery left at the end.""  That description is certainly true of the first two books in this series.  I'm definitely left mystified and wondering.  And yet, I'm not disappointed.  I don't feel that the plot was left hanging.  And somehow, I don't think I will be disappointed even if the last book in the series leaves me with the same sense of wonder - plotting and turning around all of my different theories in my mind.",A True Mystery

1909,"Note: This review was originally published on Red Adept Reviews on March 8, 2011.Overall:  3 starsPlot/Storyline:  3 starsChristina was like a junior Wonder Woman - she skydived, scuba dived, and flew airplanes like an experienced pilot after only a few hours of instruction. If the girls were a little younger, and if the more violent scenes were rewritten or deleted, the story would be appropriate - perhaps even inspirational - for younger teenagers, but the story just wasn't believable enough for me.The first third of the book, which followed the three girls from age eleven through high school, wasn't that interesting and served little purpose. There were dead ends such as the chapter where Jessica's abusive stepfather Roy beat her mom senseless, broke down Jessica's bedroom door, and tried to rape her. Jessica had telephoned Christina to help her, so Christina rushed over and stopped Roy by threatening him with her shotgun. But there was no follow-up, no calling the police, no mention of the stepfather after that. And there was very little mention of any of the girls' parents, it's almost as if they raised themselves.About halfway through the story, the action picked up and the story got more interesting when the three girls entered college. Christina started flying lessons, Heather became romantically involved with an older man, and Jessica studied old Spanish archives to locate sunken treasure. The three girls were now living their dreams. During a summer break, they embarked on a trip to the Bahamas on a treasure-hunting expedition that ended in tragedy. And this is where it really got too unbelievable for me. Christina showed flying skills that only a veteran pilot would have, even though she had not even earned her pilot's license. Her instructor had told her that she was the best student he had ever taught, but it was too much of a reach to believe she could fly planes as expertly as she did in the story.The story had too many convenient coincidences (such as an uncharted island being right where you need it) and implausible events (such as Jessica pinpointing sunken Spanish treasure that had eluded professional treasure hunters for years).I do have to say that the scene where Christina sought revenge on the culprit responsible for the Bahamas disaster was quite satisfying, even if it was a bit improbable.Characters:  4 starsChristina, Heather, and Jessica were the main characters, and the author did a good job of developing them as flesh and blood people, even if their emotions didn't always seem realistic to me.Writing style:  3 starsThe author's writing style was generally good, but the emotions and the dialogues of the story's characters were not very realistic at times. After witnessing the sudden, violent death of a close friend or relative, most people would be devastated and in shock. These characters, however, got over tragedies quickly and moved on.If you're going to have your characters engage in specialized activities, an author should be familiar with those activities. There were some glaring errors in this regard. For example, while skydiving for the first time, Christina ""pulled the ripcord and tossed it to the side."" I've skydived, and you don't toss the ripcord away, for two reasons: (1) it could kill someone on the ground, and (2) ripcords are not cheap to replace. She also pulled the ripcord at 1,000 feet, which is well below the minimum altitude for opening your parachute. Trust me, you get yelled at for things like that and get banned from a drop zone.Later, when Christina was taking flying lessons, she goes up with her instructor in a ""Citborea,"" an aerobatic aircraft. I think the author meant a Citabria.Editing:  2 starsThe book was in serious need of editing and proofreading. I found quite a few grammatical and punctuation errors, and misspellings were found every few pages. A few examples: ""ought"" for ""aught,"" ""ware"" for ""were,"" ""ya'll"" for ""y'all,"" ""brake"" for ""break,"" ""waist"" for ""waste,"" ""metamorphous"" for ""metamorphosis,"" ""depravation"" for ""deprivation,"" ""choral reef"" for ""coral reef,"" and so on.","Christina, the junior Wonder Woman"

1913,"This could have been so much better. I don't know anything about this author, so I don't know if it was her first book. If so, she has room to learn and improve.The story idea was decent, some of the writing was good. The execution needed a lot of work. She used far to many adjectives, especially when it came to the eyes. &#34;her eyes shining in awe&#34;, &#34;a mocking look in his eyes&#34;, &#34;with a tortured sigh&#34;. While these types of sentences can give depth to a story, when such descriptive language is used multiple times in each paragraph it gets too flowery.Another issue I have is the cover and title. How embarrassing for anyone to see you carrying this around. It doesn't do the story any justice and could, in fact, scare some readers away. Yes, there are sex scenes. They are definitely not as X-rated as the cover and title would lead one to believe.I got this as a free download and, honestly, didn't know if I'd ever read it since the cover gave me the wrong impression. I'm glad I gave it a chance but feel the author needs to hone her writing skills.",Too many adjectives!
1914,"4.25 StarsWEDDING BELL BLUES can be read on it's own, but I would not recommend it - as the personalities that I know and love takes a back seat to the drama of the wedding in this second book, but they creep in every now and again and without reading the first book, you will definately be missing out.The book starts off with small town Konigsburg preparing for the wedding of the year, now that Docia has agreed to marry Cal. As with all not normal wedding with a hyperactive mother of the bride - everything went bigger and larger than life and it is only with the buffer of Docia best gal pal Janie Dupree is she able to survive the day to day angst of her mother.Janie is sweet, really sweet and most everyone that meets her know immediately that she is a push over. There is a however a strand of steel that runs through Janie, but she never shows it but at the rate at which the wedding plans are going downhill it might just make an appearance. While Janie is working her butt off to make every little thing as perfect as possible for the big day - her support which is suppose to be the bestman - could not have a care in the world.Pete Toleffson is the bestman and his motto is ""if  Cal wants something done Cal will ask and if he is not asked it wasn't worth doing"". Pete is Cal's older brother and not that he is not happy for his brother, but he wants no part of the horse and pony show that was happening - this level of happiness was just something that was un-natural for Pete. Pete is a lawyer in his hometown and surprises of surprises the office is getting on fine without him, then there is Cal, he has not stopped smiling since Pete has been in Konigsburg - it's just not natural, then to top the whole mess off, the cute little pixie of a bridesmaid wants to tell him what is role is in this carnival of chaos.Things were bound to come to a head and Pete and Janie was more or less pushed together to stop the wedding train derailing. While they battle the forces of in-laws, family dramas, personality issues and even issues closer to home they find the budding seeds of attraction and appreciation growing between them.They are not fools and they make the best of what is there for them - because Pete must eventually go home and Janie is under no illusion that she has what it takes to hold a man like Pete in Konigsburg.How man ways can I say I love this book. I was determined to  read this before the end of the year and I was so pleased I did that this weekend. WEDDING BELL BLUES is a convoluted mess of comical what if's, that did eventually happen and it was a fun read.I must mention Meg Benjamin's skill first at keeping at the going ons in Konigsburg together and in a straight line, because the chaos was coming from all angles and  everyone had drama or trauma as the case might be. She still managed to maintain that small town feel to her writing style and along with some creative language. The uptight and upright new cast she introduce in this book was a perfect fit to the laid back and irreverent lot of Konigsburg.WEDDING BELLS BLUES is Pete's and Janie's story - even if it was wrapped up the carnival of Docia's wedding. Janie knew right from the moment Docia agreed to a wedding date that she was not going to do it without Janie and Janie got into the spirit of things and at time she almost feels like a dogsbody.  She kiss ass, she sucked up and she made nice and denies alot of what she wanted to get off her chest just for the sake of seeing things through to the end.Even when the bestman started looking like he had two heads for his incompetence as a bestman, she still was sweetness itself. In all that sweetness however Janie had issues closer to home - a nosey demanding mother, a almost boyfriend who will be anything but and a town that she is just coming to see the beauty of, even if it was not her first love.Meeting Pete sets off an emotional chain reaction that she was not stepping away from and she was willing to roll with the punches wherever they take her, even if it's only for a short while, no matter how she wish it was more.Pete is a heart attack waiting to happen - he gives the appearance of laid bad with not a care in the world - a whole new meaning, but underneath he was a bundle of nerves worried about job, home, family and just life in general. Janie crawled under his skin an inch at a time and he was not opposed to what it was doing to him but he was not in the business of hurt - and he had no intention of staying in Konigsburg and this he knew without a doubt will hurt Janie.The highlight of this book for book was it's natural flow from  VENUE IN BLUE JEANS, it build on the special relationships that were being formed in that first book. With an array of characters and side stories popping up, some so everyday it was comical in it's realness.I loved themI hated themand mostly, I wanted to drop a few of them in a vat of oil.But one thing I did was laugh with this book and I laughed alot.Because of this flow from book to book, I would not recommend reading this book without reading VENUE IN BLUE JEANS first because you would miss out on what made these characters who they are.All the issues that befalls a wedding and more is presented in this book and this was one of the more meatier side story, which will ultimately be the cornerstone and why we will are destined to get two more Toleffson men story. I am so looking forward to those as these Toleffson men are rouges and lovers alike.Bottom LineIf you are looking for a read that just hits the spot - with small town issues aplenty, nosey community with no remorse about being nosey and at anytime you just never know what will come out of their mouth - this is the book for you. Scandal, spite and a good fisticuff are just apart of the everyday order of Konigsburg. With loveable characters and everyone having a opinion on everything - Janie And Pete are a blessed calm in the storm - that is until they start creating their own waves.",Meg Benjamin at her chaotic best

1917,I had heard a lot about how wonderful this author was so I bought this book.I hated it.  Could not finish it at all that that is not like me.In my opinion this is no a romance.  This is more about how many ways a group of men can get one woman off.I almost gave up on this author because of this book.I finally decided to give another book by her a chance because it did sound good.I am very happy I did.  I am in the 4 book of the Nature of Desire series and love them all.  I have already bought the other 3 books.  I can't believe this is the same author.I highly recommend this author.  Just not this book.,THANK GODESS I DIDN'T STOP WITH THIS BOOK

1921,"Drabble or drivel, it's all the same in this little book of depravity. Do you gawk at accident scenes, long to see the horrible wounds in the body under the sheet or wish you had a job like mortician or medical examiner???  If you answered YES to any of these, then this book is for you. The author seems to have a fascination with torture, missing body parts, partial or full decapitation, violence against women etc..  Importantly, he shows that he has empathy...it's just misdirected toward animals rather than his fellow man.  I gave it two stars, because it is difficult to produce tiny tales of 100 words, and he has accomplished that 25 times.  I just don't feel the need to debase myself with this kind of perversity any more often than necessary.  How about you?",25 stories by which you can judge how sick you may be.
1922,The one rule of a short story is that it be short. lol.  I remember before The Wild's Call was released on kindle it was released chapter by chapter; week by week and I would anxiously wait for Monday to rush to my computer and log-on just to read it before work.It complements the trilogy perfectly.  It gives us the idea how the world was after the collapse but before the spirits completely set in.  I also loved the fast pacing and the character's growth didn't suffer at all due to the quick story flow.If you are going to read this trilogy I recommend you read this prequel as well.,It's supposed to be short.
1923,"Good read and solid plot. However, I didn't care for the heroine all that much and I felt the romance was forced. Total turn off for me when it's forced.

1926,"Cassie Jordan may be newly engaged but that doesn't stop her from thinking about the two men she left behind.  That's why she's heading back to her hometown in rural Idaho to confront her memories and feelings once and for all.Nice guy Kyle Watson and dark and brooding Alan Caine have known Cassie since she was just a little girl.  They'd been inseparable and as they grew up their feelings inevitably changed to a deep-seated desire which none of them addressed.Eventually Kyle and Alan's feelings result in a sexual frustration that needs to be assuaged so they turn to each other.  Unfortunately Cassie witnesses their encounter and jumps to the conclusion that they've chosen each other over her.  It's been three years since she last saw either of the men and she learns they now live and run a ranch together.  Kyle and Alan aren't stupid, they realize that Cassie would never choose one of them over the other so they'd agreed to share her - that had been before she'd run away.  Now that she's back it's up to them to convince Cassie that they love her and a relationship between the three of them could work.Sierra Dafoe has definitely won over many readers with her warmhearted, tender storylines.  Cassie, Kyle and Alan's unique relationship fascinated me because the men waited so long for Cassie to return to them.  Their love for her is obvious in everything they do.  One of my favorite things about this story is the differences between the men and how that plays into how she responds to each of them.  THE BOYS BACK HOME is a quick read that certainly doesn't lack for emotional impact or sexual tension.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",4.5 from Romance Junkies

1928,"This is the 1st book in the Wilder Series,though, I happened to have read it 3rd. Therefore, I already knew about Chase and Abby. I felt for them both as they both had to deal with a death of a spouse. I thought they made a very good couple with chemistry. From the other books, I knew Abby would get premonitions, so I expected that her &#34;gift&#34; would be part of this story. With that being said, I did not expect her to see and talk to the dead. I really was put off by the Ghost sub-plot in the book. It really did not add to the story and certainly turned me off, especially when it involved Chase's late wife. If I had read this book first, I am not sure I would have continued the Series. FYI- there are no Ghost in the other books in this Series.Rating 2.75",Romance with Ghosts from the past-not my thing.

1930,"Insta-lust for someone whose face you haven't seen or even spoken a word to is absolutely ridiculous. There is nothing sexy about a scene that is horribly unbelievable. And seriously, what girl has multiple orgasms literally back to back on her first time?",huh?
1931,"This is a ""story"" for those who wish to read repeated (and boring) descriptions of genitalia.  The author is very focused on the heroine's  breasts (we are repeatedly told about size and colour) and on the hero's nether regions. There was almost a story in between the anatomy fixations-- almost, but, not quite.  Instead of developing a good story the author went into soft porn.  If she wishes to write Bodice-Rippers, I do wish she would just label them so.  I had read two of her ""Bubba"" stories and enjoyed them enough to overlook the little forays into crudeness.  This book was just to low to want to read more of her work.  If she would just focus on the mystery and witty repartee, it would have been a good read.  I still have hopes for the next ""Bubba"" in the series, that she will concentrate on a good story that even your Momma could read.",crude
1932,"I love erotica, I love BDSM elements and the idea of being forced, held down, etc. This was different because the woman in this story specifically liked a certain kind of sex and a horrible event messed that up for her. I commend her for trying to take her life back but the way she did it with the hero didn't make me feel like I liked her and I couldn't really enjoy the sex scenes. This was heavy and emotional and kinda weird. The way it is written makes it hard for me to accept what happened at the end but it is fiction and therefore anything is possible. If you are not sure how you feel about this subject I recommend to pass.",Difficult :-/
1933,"I only made it to Chapter Four before giving up.I'm not talking the occasional spelling or grammatical error here. The book switches between first and third person narrative - in the same paragraph! You can't tell which character is talking or who they're talking to. The same thing with the tenses, mixing present and past - in the same sentence. It was PAINFUL.The truth is, there was some promise here. It's why I stuck around as far as I did. The characters were portrayed as being interested and involved in their own lives, with lots of hobbies. It makes a change from this type of alternate world scenario, where most characters are introduced as lonely, unfulfilled, etc. In other words, just waiting for the rescue. I would have liked to spend more time with this type of character instead, but I just couldn't stand it.I hope MacDonald gets some help from a friend willing to read this and offer instruction and suggestion in BASIC English. If she reformats this book, I would be willing to try again. As is, however, it isn't worth your time.",Can't Get Past the Formatting Issues
1934,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Brenda Novak is a very good writer, I haven't read a book of hers I didn't love.A must read!",Excellent book!
1935,"Dominant Species spends a few pages introducing us to a Marine major and his crack team of specialists and then drops them on a rebellious mining world to break open a fuel depot for an incoming invasion force. Which goes really well until they fall down a mine shaft into a deep cavern occupied by a mysterious, ancient ship. The book follows their race for survival against odds that only continue to mount against them....In short, you pick up this book and once you get past the first couple of chapters' worth of set-up, you don't put it down until the characters are safe at the other side. This is great military SF: non-stop action, great tech (there was some serious thought put into their power armor) and an unexpected plot to boot. The author has a pretty impressive background, too; seriously, his other available book is The Emergency Responder's Guide to Terrorism. That's not fiction, mind.I read some of the reviews left about this book and was puzzled by them. Some people complained there wasn't enough character development, and I wondered: good Lord, in what time? People who are trying desperately not to die don't exactly have time for deep conversations about their feelings. This book is solid action from beginning to end: you read it for the same reason you get on a roller coaster, for the adrenaline high. Dominant Species definitely delivers.I did have a couple of quibbles: the author confuses ""it's"" and ""its,"" which is tiresome if you're sensitive to grammar; years of reading forum posts have inoculated me against outrage so it didn't bother me. There were also some wordos (the author liked to use the word ""prosaic"" when he really meant ""poetic"" for instance). And the title is a little misleading given the plot. Otherwise, I found it quite enjoyable.If you're looking for a novel that reads like a summer blockbuster action flick, complete with awesome gadgets and cool extrapolations of future tech, you have got to pick this one up. You can sample it and see if you like it. The whole book's only $1.99. Cup of coffee or several hundred pages of explosions... doesn't seem like a hard choice to me. :)",Roller Coaster From Beginning to End

1938,"***Spoilers***First off, I must say that I didn't read the previous 2 books of this series; someone told me that this one was the best so I jumped straight into it. And honestly, I didn't have any trouble following.  I guess you could call this a PNR, but there isn't much world building or paranormal elements.  Only a few characters have a special power, in this case, Edward has the power to heal others.  Not sure where it comes from...its just there.  I did identify the previous 2 couples and enough of their back story was given not to cause me any confusion.My FAVORITE character was Winston, the bulldog!Edward and Jack were an okay couple.  Not too much going on there to get excited about though. :( I was really upset that through 75% of the story, the author made me believe that Jack had never been with a man before, but that wasn't true and its not revealed until he and Edward were about to have sex.  I felt betrayed.What else totally upset me was that the grandma DIED!!!  Like FOR REAL!! DEAD DEAD and in the ground!!I liked this okay, but I probably won't be reading the other books of the series.",This was cute...and sad!
1939,"&#34;The Letter Sweater&#34; is set in, NC, always one of my favorite settings, especially when it includes the ocean, beaches and coastal scenery.  The characters are somewhat realistic, the story woven around a long lost love that is found in New Bern, NC after a 30 year span.

Marriage like anything else requires hard work and communication.  It was a great story and even though it was a novella, it didn't seem like it was too short.  Of course, like with all of her stories, I wouldn't mind more, but I wasn't left with the feeling that something was missing.

They find this woman online, tell her to come over, pay her to have sex with them while teaching them, and then she leaves.First of all, why would a newly married couple need to add some spice up their love life? They just got married! Secondly, the dialogue and sex was horrible. This lady did not teach me any new things about sex that a 14 year old didn't know already. IF I were the couple, I would ask for my money back. It was just not a good read and I do not recommend. Thank goodness it was free.","No, no"

1958,"Where to start?  I wish I had read TIDAL WAVE sooner.  I loved Alexia and Joshua.  In fact, I believe that, after the ""dream"" scene betwixt the two, the childhood memory is one of my favorite parts.  It's so cute and innocent, and I think Vivan really captured how a young boy would act when being teased by the older boys in his family.  And then Alexia's innocence during the entire interaction... It made me smile.My all time favorite part of this book definitely had to be the scene when the two sleep together for the first time.  It's so tender... so loving.  I really got a sense of Joshua's love for Alexia, and I absolutely ADORED the fact that he would risk getting in trouble just to keep her safe.  Love love love!I wasn't entirely crazy about the dominance switch about halfway into the novel.  After Alexia rebukes Joshua for lying, it's like his character transforms from a dominating alpha into a little kitten with the alpha lurking under the surface... which is cute, but he simmers down in the bedroom a teensy bit.  And then Anthony, who was initially the little kitten, transforms into this dominating sex god.  Kind of weird, but hey, who doesn't love a guy who's confident in bed?  Plus, he did it for Alexia--since he knew she was too shy to start talking dirty--which makes him that more respectable in my eyes.Anthony had to grow on me, especially since I was shipping Alexia/Joshua from the start.  I'm not entirely a fan of threesomes in stories, however, this series--or more specifically, TIDAL WAVE--has made me a bit more open-minded about reading it.  But only by Vivian.  She doesn't make her sex scenes tacky.I loved the fact that, despite the story's length, there was plenty of room for character growth.  Alexia transformed from this shy, mortified creature into a true leader.  It was fun being able to witness that growth, and it was written eloquently.Just like all of her other stories, TIDAL WAVE ended on the perfect note.  I was absolutely satisfied with everything about it.  And Anthony kicked the bad guy's butt.  Woot!If you're like me and you don't read a lot of threesome stories, for whatever reason, TIDAL WAVE is the perfect introduction to this type of reading/writing.  Like I said, the sex isn't tacky, and you could tell that Alexia and Joshua really cared about each other (they were pretty much the ""main couple"" in my head, but you see the love with Anthony also, but I personally didn't find it as intense as Joshua's).  Definitely worth adding to your TBR piles.","Review from the book review blog, Book Faery"
1959,"Strange story line, Had difficulty reading and staying interested. Not interested in reading this author again . Was dissappointed .",Strange
1960,"What an unusual concept for the plot.  It was highly original and intriguing.  However the main character's monologues were too lengthy and did not advance the plot or provide an opportunity to know her better.  The &#34;head over heels&#34; love affair was just plain juvenile and not authenic as was the contrived confusion between the real murder and the murder mystery.  I loved the Christianity aspect and how the author displayed the intimate relationship that grew between God and the main character. This isn't a bad book.  It just lacks feeling, momentum, and sufficient character development to prevent boredom.","2-1/2 stars, Potential spoiler alert"

1963,This book actually had a pretty interesting and not so common storyline regarding the dragon/knight subject matter. I was very excited to see some spicy love story mixed into this interesting world created by the author and was even happier when she threw in the man&egrave;ge as part of the love story... This is also actually where she lost me :-/. Unfortunately Lars was introduced and then quickly incorporated into the relationship without much of a separate set up and that bothered me. I think I would have liked equal time between the two husbands and the emotional havoc it caused for this to be a higher rated book.,interesting start...
1964,Good read. Ready to get the other books in the series. Seems as if they are going to be good,Good read
1965,If you want really good sci-fi then get this series.  I started and finished the series in a week I liked it so well.  It is rare for me to do that.  Granted the cover art is very very poor but please (lets trot out the old saw) don't judge a book by it's cover!  Also it is a steal at the kindle price.,Love this!
1966,"The flow of the story is broken by the extensive Old Testament quotations.  The story is otherwise a typical example of the &#34;bad man redeemed&#34; genre.

1967,"It's a very short story ~ 2 short chapters ~ The story has lots of ""sexual moments"", so if that's all your wanting, this may suit you.  However, if you prefer some type of cognizant story line, this falls short. The dialogue is simplistic.  The premise is difficult to embrace ~ A society who survives on sexual energy and people walk around in clouds of their energy?  The more I think about it, the less I like it.",Very short story ~ Lots of sexual situations ~ Poor story line
1968,"What a glorious read!  The language is lovely, the story compels you to keep reading, and author knows where his story is going.  What a sheer pleasure to pick this book up.

This story was quite short and the sex scenes were very ho-hum.  I wish the author would have had more build up and developed the characters more. The sex was also very vanilla in terms of lesbian sex and it didn't turn me on. This story was totally forgettable.",Mediocre and forgettable
1971,"This is a very explicit story, which is fine. The problem I have with it is that although the main characters have a love story, their first encounters are uncomfortably close to rape. It's not what they do that makes the difference, it's the emotion, or rather the lack thereof. The bad editing is also not helpful.",Average to Not great

The beginning of the was good, I was getting into the story but for me personally I wanted more romance, the adventure the mood, the scenery describe was good but that in-depth romance between Dan and Selena I didn't feel it. In the beingning Dan was mysterious and strong but I guess the world that they were living in would leave one void of emotions at times. So again for me all in all good read but felt disappointed with the romance.Still a Good job to the author to her debut book and still look forward for more to come.",;0/
1973,"Viscount Michael Blake is a no-nonsense somewhat staid man who is trying to keep his inheritance afloat.  His father, the Earl of Warren, seems to be trying to see how quickly they can bankrupt them.  When a marriage is arranged to a Duke's daughter it looks as if their money troubles are finally behind them.  But, when the Lady in question is found in a compromising position with Michael's brother, he just can't go through with the wedding.  Now he needs a rich heiress.  The only one that looks like they fit the bill is the ""upstart"" American Emma Marks.Emma is attracted to Michael but she thinks he is too rigid for her liking.  She spends some time with him and though he proposes in the most undesirable way she decides that she will consider the proposal.  The more time she spends with him, and then there is the kiss, the more she thinks they will suit.  But, there is no way she will fit into the mold of what Michael thinks a proper English bride is.The American Heiress was a heartfelt look into the late 19th century marriage mart in both England and New York.  I was drawn in by the characters as well as their situations.  For a Historical Romance there was also some intrigue and a spunky leading lady.  You have to love those upstart Americans.

Justin Garrett is her traveling companion and associate at the law firm.  If they didn't work together, she'd definitely do him. On the plane she boldly masturbates in the seat next to him while he's supposedly napping, but he hears everything and it makes him hard. Before they left for this trip, he accidentally found a racy email to her friend on her laptop, and he knows she wants him and he knows her deepest, darkest desires. He plans to do something about it in Hawaii.They meet with their client, Mitch Magruder, who Justin apprenticed with before going to his current job. Mitch and Justin share a friendly camaraderie, and Justin knows he can count on Mitch to help fulfill Amy's fantasy. Between the two of them, they work to get Amy to relax and unwind. But can Justin get her to relax enough to give him her heart?In Unwrapped, Jaci Burton paints a vivid picture of the two men coaxing Amy into letting herself go, and letting them both seduce her. Readers will enjoy a molten-hot m&eacute;nage scene and the exquisite feeling of finally being intimate with someone you've fantasized about for years. As with all of Ms. Burton's books, this is power packed with emotion and sensuality. I love her style and how she creates believable, intelligent characters.

The  number of grammatical/spelling errors, typos and plain old misuse of words was abysmal.The story wanders all over the place with characters popping up, disappearing and then reappearing much later.Thank heavens for the ""search"" feature.I don't have any idea if the author ever reads these critiques, but if so I would chastise her for letting errors such as the following ever make it into print:Whishing for wishing (three times!), style for stile, flack for flak, neigh for nigh, dogged for dodging bullets, "" hey-fever,"" pluming for plumbing, desert for dessert, a smooth loan for lawn, loped for lopped, looser for loser, ""chentrelle, cep and morelle""  for chanterelles, cepes and morels, ad infinitum...truly depressing that such a poorly edited book would ever make it into the market.The story itself has so many branches that the reader gets lost or ends up not really caring who did it.

1982,"This book was more of a thriller-drama. I felt it lacked in the romance department. The first 3/4 th of the book was all action with adventure, and getting to know the characters. It seemed drawn out more than it needed to be. It is the last part of the book that was the best finally having romance and just when you think the story is is living up to expectations you're left hanging which I guess is to be expected since it's a trilogy. So, yes I recommend this based on that understanding.",Prophecy

1984,"I liked this book. I didn't like some aspects of the book. I understand the Hero's mom was totally against weres, I got it, it added the much needed conflict in the book. We have been told in previous books the were men are all ""alphas"" in their own ways, even if they aren't alphas in their pack. The actions of the Hero and his father were anything but alpha through most of the book, it seemed at the end, they both pulled their heads out of their butts and got it together. On the Heroine's side of the story, I got the tri-bond issue, I understand it and it was depicted well in this book. I didn't like the fact her own sister didn't try to comfort the heroine while the jealousy and other issues were brought up. It seemed the sister took the side of the Hero's way too much.

1986,"First of all I should mention that I couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I stopped after ca. 40%.I like fantasy, werewolves and vampires, in general. For some reason I just don't seem to be able to like this genre in mm-literature. Especially werewolves, because of the ""mating"". Two guys see each other, and suddenly they're supposed to live and love each other for life. No build-up, nothing.Well, I wanted to give this genre another try. (AndLone, for example, wasn't that bad, after all..).This one, however, is the most boring and unimaginative story that I've read/started in this genre so far.This is, in general, what happens in the beginning:[Be warned, the beginning might be too exciting for some of you. I really don't intend to cause a heart attack or something ...]Laine: ""Hey, you're my mate.""Dev: ""Seems that way.""*Both start having sex.*After that (next morning) the 2 characters make plans for family introducings etc. for the next day.No build-up. No suspense. No tension. Nothing!Well, that's exactly what happens, there are more words in the book of course, but that doesn't really make it more interesting.Whatever happens next (I gave up on it before), it might get a tad more enthralling, but I'm already too fed up with the beginning to really believe that it's going anywhere near ""great"", not to mention ""sublime""..But don't let my opinion scare you away from it. If you happen to like a werewolve and mating plot in mm-books and have no problems with immediate mating/falling in love, with no build-up whatsoever, who knows, maybe you'll like it...",Can it get any more boring?

1989,"I think a lot of romance authors forget to set up the background to the story and the reader misses out on a lot.  The prologue doesn't necessarily have to be really long or the length of the average book, it should just be long enough to set up everything for the series including the tone of it all.The reader is introduced to the Guardian of Hell-Geyron a beastly grotesque creature, and the Goddess of Oppression- Kadence who is beautiful beyond words.  Both have been stationed by their respective sides to guard and protect the wall into hell.  Kadence is bound to the wall so much so that if it crumbles she will die.  Geyron sold his soul to Lucifer and for that he is positioned to make sure that everything in hell stays there.  Kadence and Geyron have held these positions for centuries and they have never spoken until now.  Even though there were no words passed between them there was a mutual respect and attraction.The wall is beginning to show signs of damage and Kadence has to figure out a way to repair it.  Geyron could not help, even though he desperately wanted to.  In order to save the wall Kadence ended up making a deal with Lucifer, one she would later realize was a mistake.  While trying to repair the wall and take down the Demon Lords, Geyron and Kadence vocalize their feelings, desires, and wants for one another.  This is where it starts to get messy.  The Demon Lords have begun to truly destroy the wall.  Without revealing too much I will say that in the end all the Demon Lords are stuck in Pandora's Box.All in all I really enjoyed this The Darkest Fire.Visit us at Fairytales4grownups.com for the full review and everything Romance Novels like many more reviews and our blog.",Fairytales4grownups.com Review
1990,"This is a short review, for a solid and decent book in the very fun PsyCop series. If you haven't read any book in this series yet, please check out my reviews of the first two books in this series Among the Living and Criss Cross.  I am a fan of Jordan Castillo Price's and of this series, but this book was just good -- not great; however, it is good and it is worth the read.  It felt like a bridge book, but having read further on in the series I can say that key things do happen in this book that are important.JCP is great about pushing the line in her urban fantasy world.  Ever wonder if lost limbs leave ghostly trails?  If a person has lost a hand, or a leg -- will its former limb appear as a ghost?  JCP answers that question in this book in a gruesome yet funny scene in which Vic is meeting Jacob's family for the first time.  In addition to the stress of attempting to impress his boyfriend's family, Vic is not using his prescription meds to dull his psychic senses (which the poor guy desparately relies on) and thus has to ignore the ghostly limb, while attempting to be coherent and friendly to his boyfriend's family -- all while sober.""I avoided looking at the spot where Leon's arm was flopping around on the table.""And as Vic laments to Jacob (after Vic flees the scene),""I am trying hard to be a decent boyfriend but I think I might not be cut out for it.""Body and Soul brings Vic and Jacob closer together.  With the typical introspective but witty inner dialogue that Vic employs, the reader is treated to Vic and Jacob's developing relationship.There is a decent mystery storyline and a cop investigation that is horror filled and gruesome.  This book is a fun and quick read.  Like the previous two books in the series, there is something about it that encourages compulsive behavior and I was not able to put it down -- I had to immediately go on to the next in the series.  But despite the addicting effect, Body and Soul is not the best book in the series, it is not great but it is good.  You will not be sorry you read it and you will learn some important things about Vic and Jacob together as a couple.  Body and Soul leads straight in to the fourth book in the series -- Secrets, which in my opinion is the best book thus far in PsyCop.",Solid Read; Good Entry in the Series

1992,"When I found this on audible I gave it a try. I had read positive reviews about the series and decided to listen this sequel. First of all,if you are like me, probably you will need to listen to it twice. The first time the initial ten minutes were confusing and I couldn't follow the story.  Kept listening and began to like it, especially when she is at the hospital and interacting with Lydia.  I decided on listening again and now this series is on my radar. The premise of Soul Screamers is interesting.  Kaylee gets this uncontrollable desire to scream.  Everybody thinks she gets panic attacks but it is something more. Her situation has a supernatural motivation that I find curious and I want to know more of this character.About the characters:I find Lydia a potentially great character. She is intriguing. She has an ability that could help Kaylee but I can't help but ask myself at what price to her own safety.  At the other side of the spectrum I see Kaylee's aunt.  She doesn't sound like someone Kaylee grew up with.  I don't feel to much empathy toward her.About the narration:It took me a little time to get used to Amanda Ronconi's style.  At the book's beginning she sounded detached, almost informative.  Her voice sounded in third person although she used pronouns ""me"" and ""I"" in her narration.  As the audio progressed she definitively was Kaylee.  As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I listened to this audio twice.  The second time in my listening, Ronconi sounds detached at the same parts as well.I give a 4 to the story and a 3 to the narration.

However, the story and characters moved the story along until this last book. This book was terrible! The author spent the majority of the book on mundane things and overdramatic declarations of love. This book was annoying, it took me forever to get through it, and there were way too many useless pages between the beginning and the ending. After this book, I'm not sure that I'd recommend any in the series, because then you'd be curious about the end, so you'd read the last book.

And thank God for that cos other wise I would not have finished it.It tries to come off as erotic but it doesn't even scratch the surface of sexy. And the course it takes to be able to open up future plots for this series is just ridiculous.

2013,"The book is a very fast read and starts out very well. The main characters are interesting people, but the story quickly becomes very improbable. That will not stop the reader from hoping the various heroes  come out on top.

2014,"The story was interesting and well written. I would have given it a 3.5 stars due to the fact that Leif seemed to accept the present time and ways almost without question. That was unreal. He should have been shocked or more surprised by the modern times. The first half of the book was great other then what i have said. The second part where they go back to Icland in the 900's past was very sad and hard to read. How he treated Kat was was offending and hard to read. Knowing that time period were barbaric times didn't make it easier to read, this is a fiction book after all even though researched on facts. I overall liked this book and would reccomend it to all interested in time travel romances. Will be starting book two today.",Good Story

2021,"Ava Sweet has had a crush on her best friend's brother since high school.  After overhearing him discussing her in less than flattering terms she vows to prove to him that she's perfectly capable of being womanly - and not just `Dr. Doolittle' in baggy, ugly clothes.Luke McGiffin isn't oblivious to Ava's charms despite his attempts at denying them to his friend Pete.  The last thing he expected was for her to overhear their discussion or for Ava to lay a lip lock on Pete and demand a date that Friday night.Ava's always been shy and worn clothes that downplay her form, but Luke's oblivious attitude calls for a serious makeover and her friend Jen is more than happy to help.

Luke's a man with a strong sexual appetite and he's done his best for years to keep his desire for Ava at bay.  Is she prepared to handle his unleashed passionate nature?FORBIDDEN FRUIT is a simply delightful read that will have readers smiling their way through the antics of all the characters.  I couldn't help but laugh at Ava's reaction to Luke's thoughtless comments and how she goes about getting his attention.  I loved the realistic feel to this story and the friendship that's so apparent between Luke, Ava, Pete and Jen.  Anne Rainey charms her way into readers' hearts with flawed characters and situations that excite as much as they delight.

2024,"There is nothing better than getting a book by an author whose work I enjoy reading and the book is free (pssssst it's still free until Dec 15 - download it now!).Holiday bound by Beth Kery is exactly what you would expect from her. Don't know what to expect? Well this is not your Mother's romance. Holiday Bound is a short, sexy, sizzling erotic story. This book should have come with a disclaimer. I'm surprised my Itouch didn't instantaneously combust as I was thumbing through the pages. Yowza I was feeling all hot and bothered and it wasn't just because I was working out! I could've used a fan and a tall cool drink of water (ok I did have that close at hand) while reading this E-gniting, erotic E-read.It's Christmas. They're snowbound...no electricity...no way out...no help on the way and only each other to warm the long cold night ahead. Is this a recipe for disaster or a wild fire about to burn out of control? Dear Santa: if you're planning on coming down their chimney - you better watch your boots don't catch on fire.Alex Carradine left the big city and his life as a mover and a shaker in Chicago 4 years ago when he decided to chuck it all and retreat to Holiday Valley to run a ski resort. Alex is sceptical and with good reason when his estranged father Mitch wants to visit for the holidays and bring his latest and greatest main squeeze along for the ride. Maybe hell has frozen over, but Alex is willing to give Daddy Dearest the benefit of the doubt and what better time to try and rebuild their relationship than Christmas....a time for giving.Of all the dumb luck! Alex can't believe the woman he's just rescued from the stranded SUV on his property is Angeline Kastakis...this is his Dad's new girlfriend? Angeline...the woman he fantasized about 4 years ago and hasn't been able to forget? And where is Mitch? What is his father up to now? Is Father Christmas playing a cruel joke on Alex by tempting him and his willpower with Angeline Kastakis? And to top it off...now they're home alone for the holidays.Angeline is conflicted about her feelings for the intense and gorgeous Alex - son of the man she's in a relationship with. She agreed to this little get-away with Mitch so they could explore their relationship and hopefully take it to the next level. But Alex is a force to be reckoned with when he's in full out attack mode...and he's got his sights on Angeline. I might have had a momentary twinge about how easily Angeline caved to Alex's aggressive approach considering she was supposed to be dating his father, but I got over it quickly. Alex is a take charge kinda guy.There is lots of steamy, smexy action including interestingly enough an explicit encounter involving some gym equipment...mmmm...I may never look at that equipment the same way again. It also probably explains why I was breathing a little extra hard.Want to add a little Christmas present to your E-reader? Download Holiday Bound, sit back and enjoy.",Ho Ho Ho Hot for the Holidays

It was long, over done and did not meet my expectations of exceptional reading.  Roxanne and Frank were naracissistic children who both needed to think before they acted.

This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions, curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter, more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect.",A Dark Little Fairy Tale

When they weren't having sex, they were talking about it. The sex overwhelmed what would have been an otherwise good story. If you like lots of sex and little story, than this book is for you.

Five years ago Sheriff Nicholas Demetris met him and wanted him but only now,  when the card board crazy is on  his way back,  does the opportunity arise to make his move.

2044,"Count Albritton is a paranormal private investigator. For example, he helps people figure out if they are really stalked by a vampire and what to do about it. As the story begins, we find Count in a hospital,  a would-be assassin with a pillow and a knife at his side. Soon, he is embroiled with a lot more than saving his own skin.On the plus side, there is a great cast of characters from the supernatural world : guardian angel, immortals, demons, sorcerers, vampires,in a sort of D&D-ish; world where it's all about the mission and not a lot of thought is put into planing.On the minus side, I was annoyed with the many flashbacks. Going back and forth was really confusing and the connections between now an then were awkward. On at least two occasions, I found myself going back a few pages, trying to figure out just what was going on. There is also a lot left unexplained and probably not on purpose. It felt more like the author had the basis of his novel so clear in his head that he forgot that we didn't know what came before or who (or what) the characters really are.For the same atmosphere, I suggest the Sandman Slim novels. There are better crafted and the writting is way superior.",Good but not great

They are written about young people who are faced with trials. With God's help (the author does not preach) and some help from friends and family they are able to overcome. This is a story of good versus evil, and has not only an element of fantasy, but is a good romance as well. Good for readers Jr. High and up. I think geared for YA. I do feel like there is some things left unexplained, some of the characters and who they are are a little vague. I would have given it four stars had things been a little clearer. These books need to be read in order. Not stand alone. I will definitely finish the series. No swearing or sexual content, some violence",Love and Faith

2050,"I didn't exactly like this book but I didn't hate it either. It is very long without any real story going on. The Character's aren't consistent and neither is the plot. Here are my problems with it:1. Jasmine (the heroine) she starts off seeming strong and independent. Then becomes immature at times and even submissive and sometimes flaky. Then she's back to acting strong again. She keeps flip-flopping from one way of thinking and acting to another.2. Keilan (her love interest) starts off seeming concerned about scaring her and not wanting to harm her in the beginning. He then turns into a dominating molester within the next chapter or so. He again becomes a sweet romantic love interest halfway in the book then dominating again. It's very confusing who these people are and what they are about. There were many other characters mentioned but you barely know them or understand where they are coming from either.3.The genre didn't seem to fit what was actually in the book. Yes there is some romance, there is fantasy/sci fi but there is also erotica in the book. I wish the author picked a genre and just went with it instead of tried to blend so many in one. She goes into descriptions of each in different scenes but the tone and feel of each scene doesn't always feel like the same book. Primarily the sexual aspects seemed really obscured compared to the rest of the book. I wish she would of just chose Full erotic novel OR Full romantic novel. Neither aspects seemed to blend together or stayed consistent in this book. Also the sexual aspects were so few and far between in the first half of the book that it seemed out of place.4. OK so the book is about a girl with Charmer abilities (can seduce shifter men with her scent basically) who happens to be best friends with a shifter princess. Why should we, as the reader, care about this and what does it have to do with the story itself? I'm not sure about that answer. Again if this was a full erotic novel some of the sexual themes and her seductive powers would make more sense. Like the sexy clothing and underwear in the beginning, is suddenly forgotten after the first &#34;molesting scene&#34; then she's able to wear dresses and regular shirts and pants. What was the point of that?? And a scene where an aphrodisiac was used then backfired to cause a loss of sex drive just didn't fit in. But since this is a romantic/action/fantasy I think?? I'm not sure why we should care or where the author was taking us with all this. Or why so many things were mention just to be resolved and forgotten about within a page or so later.So in a nutshell, there were things about it I liked. Things I didn't like and things that just didn't make sense to me. There were a lot of scenes and characters that could have been cut from this book to give it a more focused feel and shorten it. I hope the author chooses to rework this one and give it  more structure. She had a lot of cool ideas and interesting world she created but I feel her story needs more planing. I will not be following the series but I enjoyed most of the journey in this book.",It keeps going and going and going...
2051,"Federal Judge Jackson Benedict is trying a case involving the favorite son of a notorious family, when he begins getting suspicious ""gifts"" and threatening notes.  Despite his objections, Federal Agent Trey London insists he needs protection.  Jackson is attracted to Trey, and Trey seems to feel the same, but will Jackson live long enough to do anything about it?Court Appointed takes the stereotypical ""important person needs protection and falls for the bodyguard"" story and gives it an interesting twist.  Making both parties men changed the dynamic of the story considerably, especially when Jackson thinks Trey is overreacting or treating him like a woman.  Sexy, determined Trey and stubborn Jackson are both likeable characters.  The love scenes are hot.  The suspense angle was well done for the most part, and coincidences and red herrings kept it interesting.  Really, the only flaws in this book were Jackson's father, whose over-the-top, controlling behavior seemed a bit much, and the resolution of the stalker angle, which I thought was abrupt.  Overall, Court Appointed was a hot and entertaining read, and I give kudos to Annmarie McKenna for turning an old romance clich&eacute; into something new.Cassiereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Court Appointed

She's not looking for a lifelong love or even a long term relationship but she'd love to find a master who can bring out the full extent of her passion.Even after all this time Jane is still hurt by Peter's betrayal and knows trusting anyone with her heart or body will not be easy.  Her best friend and business partner Lily accompanies her to a bondage-themed event that their business R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up.  It's more than just networking for Jane though, it's her first foray back into the BDSM scene and she just hopes to find one man who appeals to her.Once they arrive at the party location, Lily and Jean Jacques settle into their non-interested attitudes despite the fact that the sexual tension between them is practically off the charts.  Jane's just waiting for Jean Jacques to toss Lily over his shoulder and show her just what she's missing.  Jane spends the evening hunting for a potential master for the night but no one's sparked an interest.  What she doesn't realize is that Antonio Villareal spotted her the moment she entered the ballroom and he has every intention of getting to know her - in every way possible.Antonio isn't having the best of luck when it comes to women.  Sure, he's rich, gorgeous and single but women are only after him because of what they'd gain by being seen on his arm.  He's looking for a submissive woman to share his life and has set his sights on Jane.  The only problem is she's told him upfront she isn't looking for a happily-ever-after.  Some really hot sex in the here and now will do wonders for her but anything further is more than she's willing to consider.  Will Antonio be able to convince her that she can have all the smoldering sex she could ever want if she'd just give him a chance?Dominique Adair's storylines are ones that I'm consistently drawn to over and over.  Her plots and characters never fail to draw the reader into the storyline while promising to seduce you with each heat filled scene.  In SEDUCING JANE PORTER we're introduced to Jane, a character who's love and trust was horribly abused yet she's brave enough to attempt another foray into the BDSM world.  Antonio is exactly the sort of master Jane desires - even if she isn't aware of it yet.

2056,"Initially from the prologue this seems to be a science fiction story about alien invasion however that is really a clever ploy to set the scene where a mountain community is stranded and have to survive with only their own resources. Unlike most ""survival / stranded / desert island"" stories because of how this is set up civilisation for this mountain community is not destroyed so they have the resources that are there and do not have to build from scratch exactly. Initially the story is set in a teenagers' camp with no adults where a resourceful 13 year old becomes ""chief"" and leads the camp through a number of adversities. The story is simply written and the problems encountered are too easily overcome but all of the characters and locations are well described so that I can visualise them.

2070,"Very brief story.  Enjoyable but not a lot to it.  The hero and heroine have been married long enough to fall into a rut.  The husband, a twin, has always wondered whether his wife might have preferred his brother (because the twins had swapped places a couple of times during the married couples courtship because the husband has always felt less socially adept than his twin).  The heroine has always been able to tell the difference between the twins and has never doubted she married the twin that she wanted to marry.  Still, they've settled into comfortableness and she wants passion (and she fears her husband may have strayed --though he hasn't).  Over breakfast she makes an outrageous statement about possibly taking a lover, jolting her loving if inattentive  husband into action.Nice story. Loving couple.

2071,This one made me mad. I thought I was getting a whole book. I started to get interested in it and it ended. It came out as a teaser that didn't set well with me. I'd like to read the whole book.,Disappointed
2072,"It was not helpful for what I was looking for, and I thought it was pretty much crap. Sorry, but it wasn't very good.  Sorry.",it sucks.
2073,"What a delightful novel! The characters were well-rounded and extremely likeable. I also appreciated the effort that was put into Povre's native language. In addition, the plot was intriguing and I didn't want to stop reading. I'm looking forward to more from this author!",Captivating
2074,"I read a lot of the other reviews before I started this book.  I was absolutely fascinated by the number of 'love it' and 'hate it' reviews, and how varied they  were, and I finally had to read it for myself to find out.  There was also the discussion about editing, and the errors that were rife through the book, with the author assuring us that an editor had been brought on board, and the book no longer has issues.In a 'light' fun read, I overlook some errors, and try not to dwell on them.  Life's too short to nit pick.  But I'm afraid more editing is still needed in this book.  I believe the author is serious about her craft, and wants to write more books, so I'm sure she will want to make sure her product is as good as it can be.  That will keep people coming back for more.As a story, there wasn't enough depth for the length of the book.  The story was fine, but long, detailed discussions of each meeting or encounter took up too much of the book.  I can accept someone getting that head over heels feeling at first sight, but looks are not enough to carry a long term relationship, or being ""in love"", and there was very little development of the characters beyond the ""mile wide back and rippling muscles"" and hair that smells like coconut.  And some details shifted somewhat in the book - Avery was 5'9, then 5'10, then 5'9 again.  I didn't pay a lot of attention to her physical appearance, but felt the author did not have a firm grip on how the characters looked either.  I like to imagine the characters for myself, but get thrown when the details don't add up, or don't remain consistent. Many times, I had an impression the heroine was a tiny, petite girl, (with an a cup bra size) but then a height of 5' 9"" (or 10"") and size 9.5 shoes isn't petite at all. And how many shades of brown can one head of hair be?There were spots where it looks like an attempt at editing was made, and corrected text was inserted, but not all of the old text was removed.  I do think the author has potential.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have attempted to pinpoint the things about this book that kept it from earning a higher rating from me. Another round of editing could easily bring the grade up another point or two.  The author does have a talent for descriptive scenes, and the reader will feel they are part of them.  But technical errors distract, and jar me back to reality, spoiling the effect of the scene she had spun.  I feel this author will take reader feedback, and continue towards excellence.","Sex, Love & Sex"
2075,Not really what the title says.. He doesn't go out and just shoot people..  Well thought out and worth reading...,very good.
2076,"This book was WAY too short for the storyline (yeah, usually I complain about the opposite too). The plot was intriguing, interesting and very different - and let's face it, a lot of books out there are just a constant rehash. There were so many different ways the author could have taken it, but it ended so quickly. I wonder why she chose to not delve deeper into the characters and flesh out the plot? This book could have been absolutely fabulous, instead it feels like an unfinished book. I give it 4 stars for the great book idea alone. I hope the author decides to do something else with this idea or maybe build off of what she has here.","Fantastic plot idea, not fleshed out enough"
2077,"I love a menage tale that's not just about the sex, but about three (or more) people establishing an enduring, loving relationship.

Highly recommended.",Hot sex grounded in true love

Okay--it really was fun, in a strange sort of way, but the sophomoric writing style coupled with an inexcusable number of errors and omissions stole the fun and, therefore, the enjoyment. I certainly hope this fairly prolific author has learned to put out a better product with his later works because this first one is a disaster.

This book, in my opinion, had little. Dialogue was weak, boring and amateurish...in my opinion. I also (foolishly) downloaded her 2nd book before reading this one, but could only read about 10 pages before giving up.

Constant, ineffective, pointless shifts in point of view (yes, Dear Author, I'm speaking to you). Characters LOL stupid. Plot mind-numbingly predictable. Graphic sexual scenes LOL ludicrous as they shift diction constantly for names of genitalia and sexual activities.

2097,"I love Grace Livingston Hill's books. They're sweet innocent love stories with good morals and likable characters. Keep in mind though, that this story takes place in pre-civil war New York state and that the story was written in the early 1900's. A side-plot involves the hero becoming an abolitionist which puts him at odds with his pro-slavery uncle. The views expressed by the characters are far from politically correct and one evil character uses the &#34;N&#34; word. Just beware. That aside, the story is about sweet, orphaned Phoebe fighting against being married off to an oaf while she makes friends with the handsome, upstanding hero....the fun is that Miranda (from the first book in the trilogy) is able to provide just the right help at the right time and everyone can tell how it ends of course....!",Sweet and old fashioned

This seems to be the basis for the novel and the love between a woman's who's spent her life being scared of risk and loss, thanks to a big, predictable and over-dramatic ""secret"", and the solar, carefree Aidan. The story line lacks direction and purpose, in the sense that the whole of the plot seems invented as a means to fill in the gaps around Aidan and Hannah's relationship and feelings for one another.As for ""learning to swim"", it does not feel like Hannah is really letting go of her fears.There were some good parts about the parent-child relationship, but mostly I was plain not convinced by the book.",A lot of angst and not so much consistency

Yeah, right.I am new to this genre, but read it to see what a paranormal fantasy novel was about.  The story had potential and could have been a lot of fun, but not one single story thread was developed.  Characters were interesting, but when Leo ran around saying, ""Mom!"" and wrestling with his sister I couldn't quite buy into the alpha male hero in him.  And when he ran back and forth on the driveway while Ruby was kidnapped, he sounded downright silly, but only because of the way the author handled it.I thought the book was for teenagers - perhaps it is - it used plenty of slang - perhaps not the most current - and the sex sounded like the dirty notes middle school girls used to pass to middle school boys quite a number of years ago.  Love equals A_s, and P___y, and rabbit vibrators?  etc?  My,my.After I have read a book, I either keep it on my Kindle for rereading, or I archive it if it is not worth repeating.  I archived it.

2110,"I loved this story.  Indeed, once I started it, I didn't want to put it down.  It was a charming, romantic retelling of the Beauty and The Beast story set in Regency England.  Louisa, an heiress, was an ugly duckling who wanted someone to care for her, not her fortune.  Her parents had passed and she was living with her grandfather who wanted her to be married.  Douglas, a vampire with a conscience, was a loner in the extreme.  He was living in a cave with no interaction with others besides what he physically needed to survive. He had his own inner demons to fight as he was guilt-ridden from an incident early in his life.  The day Louisa stumbled upon Douglas' cave was a life-changing event for both of them.  Karen skillfully used their interplay of words to develop their relationship.  There were a few other characters and scenes interspersed in the story but most of the story took place in the cave.  I enjoyed this book very much.  I was very happy with the ending and actually came away from the book feeling as if I'd learned a valuable lesson from it.

When it didn't, I felt cheated. The set up was great, the characters artfully drawn, and the story itself had great potential. But from where I sit, it seems Lippman abandoned the potential and just stopped writing, rather than going to the effort of finishing the story in a satisfying way.

So I read about 35 percent of the story and couldn't take it any more, so I stopped reading it. To me that is not romance.

2141,"Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed this short little novella.  It was a fascinating concept to, for once, have the tables turned.  As the story progressed, I was beginning to see the ending coming, but I always wondered just who it was that was going to come out on top.  The way this author ended this short, quaint little story had me laughing at the end, which gave me some very interested looks from people sitting around me.  It was twisted, and it was perfect.  A dose of your own medicine, indeed.  I would like to read more of this author's.  The only negative I can really say is that I would've liked to get to know the players a little better.  I was teased with a taste, and then it was ripped from me.  That, though, was part of the enjoyment, and it kept me wanting to find out more, and had me guessing about what the author didn't actually tell us.

2145,"Pleasant reading but not much of a mystery. Central characters well-drawn but the action defied credibility. The resolution of the multiple dilemmas and crimes makes little sense, with the fate of the various characters having little logical connection to their prior activities. With a well-structured, logically coherent outline and some respect for reality, the author could do quite well with the next one. At a reasonable  price, this one will pass muster as a light tale about middle aged women and their difficulty in achieving a modest degree of equilibrium in their relationships.",Middle Aged Women trying to cope

I have read the 1st two books in the series, Bite My Fire, and Biting Nixie....I enjoyed them because there was plenty of romance and steam, but there was also a good story, somewhat of a mystery, and a happy ending.  All must haves for me to enjoy a book.  The books could be stand alone, but you would miss the back story of some of the characters which carry over to the next book.  The main characters do change in each book, but are introduced in the previous book.  If you like vampire stories, give this series a shot.  This is a book for adults only, not recommended for teens.

2153,Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR,mysterious island

The situations they go through require a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief and there's never a point where I thought, ""Oh, okay. I get it"" about their relationship.

2157,I enjoyed this book though don't know how much I would have felt this way if I had paid for the book. I liked the characters though some seemed not fully fleshed out. Mr. Hamerton had many threads running through the novel. Some seem superfluous. I don't want to state a spoiler so I won't elaborate. It also took a long time to get going because of the many themes.

I gave it 2 stars instead of the 1 that I had initially planned to give it because it really isn't the worst book i've read.

2160,"I enjoyed this story by Kallysten (as I have all that I've read by her).  Brett is human and the owner of On The Edge, a club that caters to both vampires and humans.  Lisa is his vampire lover and silent partner.  They have a good relationship, one that isn't the usual vampire-human one in that Lisa hasn't bitten Brett (she doesn't want to see him as food).  She is on the hunt one evening in the club and is surprised to see Leo, her old lover and fellow vampire.  She couldn't remember why they had parted 15 years ago but found it wonderful to be in Leo's arms again.  From this point on, (no I'm not going to spoil it for you), you read about how Lisa, Brett and Leo develop a relationship between themselves.  It is a hot and spicy read and I am looking forward to reading the next story, Over The Edge, that continues Brett, Lisa and Leo's story.I received an ebook from the author for the purpose of an honest review.

2174,"I started this novel with high hopes, but these were dashed not long into the slow-moving plot. I found it very hard to believe that the main character could keep asking why the ""villain"" did this or that? It was obvious what he was doing which was ripping off the father for hundreds of thousands of dollars.The clues were totally unsubtle, the heroine very stupid. Why would she rush off to confront someone whom she suspects of fraud and murder, thus giving him plenty of time to cover his tracks? Her relationship with her lover is most unconvincing, as she asks him to wire her an enormous sum of money and agrees to marry him, but then doesn't bother to check her emails.The descriptions of the landscape take over pages of what should have been well-written mystery. Nothing in this novel was a mystery and the ending felt as though the author had suddenly realised that she has to finish the book, so rushed through the final denouement in a page or two.Most disappointing.

At first it seemed to be very bitty - it skipped from one set of characters to the next without letting me get them sorted in my head. Once I had them all straight, and the threads started to come together, I realised just how well it was done.There were so many brilliant characters and memorable scenes, as I said in my title, they keep on coming back. I think that the slapstick humour at first masks the quality of the writing. When I tried to come up with a couple of quotes that stood out, it wasn't the funny stuff, but the more quiet and reflective bits that came to mind.I thought the ending was lovely, and unexpectedly moving.

There is a very brief beginning in which a young French royal friend of Maxon's (what? I thought he had no friends? Whatever.) sort of throws herself at Maxon and he declines. The story immediately moves to the beginning of the Selection and into familiar territory. All we really read is Maxon's perspective of that familiar story and his interaction with the girls. The only interesting bit in my opinion was getting to see why he sent some of the girl's home during the breakfast ceremony. We also see his first interactions with Kriss, and I guess that was kinda interesting. I still can't give it three stars because I feel that the blurb was very misleading and teased the buyer with something it didn't deliver. Asking us to pay a few more dollars for basically the same exact story told through Maxon's eyes felt cheap and disrespectful. I had planned to buy The Queen but if it is really just a retelling of The One through Queen Amberly's eyes then I might read it, but I sure won't pay for it.Buyer Beware.",This is NOT the Story of Daphne and Maxon

John found himself alone in a dark, cold basement that held only a toilet and--surprisingly--an old wall-type telephone that wasn't even connected. As John lost hope and despaired of his fate, he heard the old telephone ring. Was it his frightened imagination, or was someone else really on the line?I enjoyed the story very much. The storyline could have led to some explicit nastiness by the villain, but it didn't. After steadily building up tension, the story's climax was a surprise, but in the context of the story, it was a logical ending.

What makes this genre the ultimate in horror is how fast & easy the plot could, and perhaps has, played out in the mundane world.What bothered me about this book was the vagueness that the reader is left to interpret and struggle through at times. But more than that were the loose ends left dangling... Who was Yencha and what did he really want? Why was the first doctor killed? What happened to the redneck thugs in Austen? Who were Danny's people? And most of all, where did Vroden go? Did he get lost? Fall in a mine shaft never to be heard from again? Run over by a train?

During a trip to the mall with her best friend, Emma, she finds herself having what she calls a ""panic attack"".  She has always had these but has never had a full explanation of their cause.  The moment she sees a boy in a wheelchair she feels one of her ""panic attacks"" coming on.  The difference between this panic attack is that this she not only screams uncontrollably but it also lands her in the Mental Ward.  After screaming her lungs out to the point of exhaustion she wakes up strapped to a bed, unable to move, in a small white room.  During her forced ""sentence"" in the Mental Ward she meets a very interesting fellow patient, who herself has a special ability (but no spoilers!).Rachel Vincent's prequel is a wonderful glance and explanation into Kaylee's personal experience with her pre-bean sidhe knowledge.  In the following novels, thoughts of her time in th Mental Ward are brought to the surface more than once.  She constantly struggles with the affect of her bean sidhe gift and how for the longest time she thought she might have actually been crazy.  This in turn has affected her, in more ways than one.  My Sou to Loose also helps answer many questions that come up in the following novels (again no spoilers!). It also shows how strong Kaylee is - not many girls go to the Mental Ward, then learn that they help souls by screaming their lungs out, live for hundreds of years, all in a few months time and then have the mental capability and maturity to accept it and embrace it.As always, Rachel Vincent's ability to write in perfect detail astounds me.  In My Soul To Loose Kaylee visits the Netherworld for the first time, even though she has no idea what it is, let alone has a name for it.  Rachel Vincent's descriptions of this world sends chills up your spine.  Unlike in the following novels, she is very careful to not give away too much of this world - she gives you just enough taste of the gruesomeness and terrifying creatures that inhabit it.For those that have not had the opportunity to read or start the Soul Screamers series I would first say ""WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!"" and then I would recommend that you read at least the first book before reading this prequel.  My Soul to Loose is a perfect addition to this series.",Review by Patricia's Particularity

But it was hard to. While I thought the plot could have gone a lot of different ways, it turned out to be exhaustingly predicable and one-dimensional. The business that Sarah, Jeffrey, and Moira are in is a big part of the story, but it was never explained. I had no idea what they were doing, and each time business was talked about, I just became confused. And the book should have been run through an editor.

He asks for three days to paint her portrait and in return the painting is hers.  What he hides from her is that he knows he has found his lifetime muse even if she denies love exists; he has three days to persuade her otherwise.These are three terrific erotic romances starring full blooded (well the males in many scenes have the blood rushing to their lower heads) characters who turn this into a Bella delightful compilation.Harriet Klausner",three terrific erotic romances
2206,"This is one of Verne's better books. It's evenly paced, with believable characters, and balanced dialogue.However, it suffers from the same malady as all his books do, that it was padded out with unnecessary facts until in stretches it tends to read like a museum tour guide.Still, it's an enjoyable read and also made a decent movie.",not a bad read
2207,"This was an ok read to me, was it ok yes, was it great no. The book is very well detailed and the characters are well developed. The story had many interesting twists and turns and your trying to figure out what will happen next. The story tends to go in and out, through out different timelines so prepare yourself for that, it shouldn't be too confusing. Lyra, is an innocent girl she has a good heart and was raised by her adoptive mother, Nick isn't what he seems and Michael a sweet guy. The other characters also brought something to the book.What I didn't like even though the beginning got your interest, it started out slow.  Patience was the key in finishing the book for me.  In ebook format the length is around 5781, as it took time to get into the plot, the plot is what kept me going. Also for a book with such length the ending was not what I thought it would be, a disappointing ending. Again, it was an ok read love the storyline but not the progress of the book if that makes sense.**************",;0)
2208,"Indigo Spell is a fairly quick, not unpleasant read. If you're looking for steamy love scenes, you'll find them here, for sure. There may, infact be too many of them. As is often the case with erotic novels, the author resorts to some hokey euphemisms for the characters' sex organs (petals of her sheath, anyone?) Still, the characters' encounters will get you riled up.With that said, the characters lack depth, making it difficult to become invested in their outcomes. I can't help feeling some of the time spent on the sex scenes would have been better spent fleshing out some of the supporting cast a little better. As a result, what should have been two touching scenes at the end of the book lacked conviction and warmth. The book got off to a strong start, then petered out (no pun intended) toward the end. Transitions became sloppy and there's one unnecessary flash back (yay, gratuitous sex!) that I found it hard to care about.Do I regret reading this? No. Am I invested enough to continue the series? Probably not unless the second book comes up free.",Not Bad
2209,"From the description of this book I was really excited to read it (especially because it is(/was) a free kindle download). I was expecting to really become lost in this story as I have with other post-apocalyptic (kind of...) stories, but unfortunately it just wasn't a must-read for me. Until I got my kindle and started reading free kindle downloads I wouldn't really have considered not reading a book all the way to the end, but book got very close to being deleted before the end. The thing was, every time I started feeling like I just didn't want to read any more something would happen that would draw me back in enough to keep me reading. In the end I actually did get some level of enjoyment out of reading this book because by the end I was unhappy that there wasn't more of it to read. A good part of this was probably because of the questions that were left unanswered.The story is about a group of elitist people in a city who decide to start their own invitation only city....by building it directly on top of the city that's already there. The author doesn't do a great job of describing exactly how this works though (stilts? support columns? what???), and doesn't explain at all how what is going on with this city relates to what is happening in other places around the world. Is this the only city like this or are there more?I could have gotten over all the left out logistical details about the city seeing as the book was free and I eventually found myself mildly entertained, but the character of Malcolm would have been better left out. Adding Malcolm into this story added a sci-fi element that just did not mesh at all with the rest of the story. He felt like some throw-away character that came out of no-where just so the author could claim he'd done some sci-fi work.",Random character almost ruins the story. Important details left out.
2210,"Wow! out of the chute action, romance and one Hot Outlaw named Cal Ryker!***************This is a follow up from RIDING WEST (believe me when I say it means Celia was ""hehehe...riding Parker West!""..not the compas direction..)

Cal's original plan to just keep Laurel safe until he can return her to her family, goes awry when they find themselves alone for 2 weeks!.......(2 steamy weeks)What starts out as a hasty rescue winds up as more of a heartfelt romantic tale complete with smart, sassy and sexy dialogue as only Emma can conjur. This is one short tale that packs alot of romantic pillow talk and honest character development that will make you ""sigh"" and beg Emma for more, more, more of those West/Evans's stories.","A great ""Stockholm Syndrome"" tale if their ever was one.........."
2211,"Sydney is an in-demand photographer who takes photos of concerts, bands and musicians. Ben is the lead singer of a famous rock group. When Sydney takes a job to photo-document Ben's US tour, they meet and sparks fly.This book started out well. The characters seemed intelligent and even Ben, a late 30's veteran of the rock world, was believable as a guy who had had enough of the fast lane and was holding out for the real thing. But Sydney was a hellacious bitch to everyone. I found it hard to believe that ANYONE wanted to hire her, no matter HOW good her pictures were. She was THAT rude.I understood, from the beginning of the book, that some guy (presumably a musician) had done a number on Sydney (we aren't told what happened until later, but I guessed, easily).  But the way she was automatically in attack mode with every guy she met, was just nuts. Especially when The Incident happened like seven years before this. I am sure it was traumatic but after seven years I would assume she would have developed better coping methods, at least at work. If she had been reserved and avoided flirtations but was clever and could hold her own, she would have been FAR more likable. As it was, I couldn't fathom what Ben, who really was a nice guy, ever saw in her other than her looks (which she dressed to hide.) They had barely spoken one civil word to each other before he seemed to be totally into her. It made zero sense and was completely unrealistic.Then he proceeded to chase her for the rest of the book even though her actions and emotions gave out crazy mixed signals. He even forgave her after barely a minute's anger when she did something I thought was SO reprehensible, I have no idea why he didn't go ballistic on her. But no, he was still hanging in there beyond what anyone (normal? real?) would ever do.A lot of this back and forth (him chasing her as she puts up Huge GO AWAY signs and runs away) happens repeatedly and after a while I was forcing myself to keep reading, hoping it would get better. It didn't.In addition, the story has a number of plot inconsistencies:Why, when there were a number of violent altercations, including the death of someone famous, is there is no mention at all of consequences or paparazzi?In fact, except for controlled interviews, there are almost no paparazzi seen anywhere, ever. And when two guys have a brawl inside a room filled with journalists, nobody mentions a word of it online or in the news.Why would Ben buy a house in Maryland when he knows no one there and his family lives in Northern California? Are there NO beach houses for sale on the Pacific Coast?Why would Sydney's agent tell so many BIG lies for her? At one point I thought her agent (Carole? Can't remember as no character was all that interesting) was going to get rid of Ben with her lies and then declare her own feelings for Sydney and start a bisexual love triangle. Would have added SOME interest to the story, at least.Also, it pissed me off when Ben's ex-girlfriend saw Sydney and told Ben, &#34;I can see why you love her, she's very beautiful.&#34; Really? That's why you love someone? But it actually seemed that way, because he was so infatuated with her so quickly and for no discernible reason.In any case, I wasn't going to write a review, I just wanted to move on and forget this one. But I decided to spare others from the boredom I endured while reading this book. There is a happy ending, but by the time it rolled around, I didn't care.Save your money and buy something else. You'll thank me.I would NOT recommend this book.",Disappointing and slow

2216,"I found this short short story a little off-putting.  The beginning was kind of comic, like a children's book, with the repetion of 'dark dark' over and over again.  That made the ending a rather abrupt shock that I didn't like.  Other than this, there was no plot and no character development - so the whole point was to draw me in to give that shock, and I didn't enjoy it.",Reminds me of a bad joke
2217,I loved that Megan's got a mate...it was a needed end to a series. The angst of her journey was well written if a little more intense than I liked. I would've let Lex beat the snot out of him! Because  Shane was not any kind of alpha hero but a selfish self-centered snotty momma's boy. Lauren did not ease me into liking him...he was spoiled and shallow from the beginning as a written character and she never corrected that impression thru his words and deeds ...so the end came and I didn't believe in the change of heart.

There wasn't one here and instead the author has waaaayyy too many sex scenes - too much of it makes it boring.  My interest in the story actually perked up on the assassination attempts that's how flat I found the romance.  The story got really weird with the menage and the admitted orgies between mated partners - really turned me off as it cheapened the whole idea of a true mate.  I did appreciate that gay relationships were represented.",2/12 stars...do not understand the other high starred reviews

Craig meets Grace starts dating her, Tabitha gets mad, he falls in love with a Grace, Tabitha keeps sleeping with him. He wants to finalize the divorce to marry Grace, Tabithat gets superly angry all the while meeting new guys to date and sleeping with them.

Craig sleeps with her but after they have sex he thinks she's asleep and receives a text from his Fianc&eacute; of naked pictures saying she misses him. He responds to the  text WHILE laying in the bed with Tabitha saying "" I miss you too and can't for you to be Mrs. smith"" she cries herself to sleep and  blah blah blah!Tabitha was a mother of two who didn't know herself or what she wanted. She kept dating LOSER guys and screwing them all! There wasn't ONE guy she went on a date with and didn't screw! She was childish and immature acting and she made me sick. This book was so not worth the money heck it isn't even worth buying in my opinion. Maybe this book isn't for ppl in my age group Tabithat was 28 but she asked like an 16 yr old child. So this book to me read as that of an 16 yr old high school student who was just lost and needed to find herself. The book even ended horribly to me she didn't learn anything she was still single and still hating on the fact that Grace has taken her place in Craig's family and she wasnt that special anymore. Tabitha went through all this hell in her dating life to make it to the end of the book and she still had no growth.",Not Worth It

2230,"I'm not going to bother discussing the content. Anyone looking at these reviews probably knows what The Economist is and believes the content to be great. The issue, here, is the Kindle offering, most notably, the price.Yes, it's expensive, and yes, I wish they'd reduce it a bit. But I'm not as outraged as some other reviewers.In comparing Kindle vs. web and paper, it is reasonable to consider, among all the factors discussed by others, the nature of Kindle itself. I notice that with the Kindle subscription, I find myself comfortably reading pretty much the whole issue. With print, I read just a small fraction.One factor, undoubtedly, is font adjustment. I'm getting to the age where reading hard-copy newspapers and magazines is becoming a bit of an exertion, so this is a huge factor. Of course web browsers allow for font adjustment, but I spend enough time working in front of a computer. I do cherish opportunities to do some things in different settings, such as an easy chair, or out on the lawn.I also wonder if the more stripped-down emphasis on text is a factor as well. There's not as much to look at with the Kindle edition (they do try to put in some pictures and charts, but visuals are not what Kindle does best). With the magazine, there's so much to look at, I spend too much time going back and forth. Ditto the web site, where there are so many things to click on. With Kindle, there are lots of little easily-digestible text nuggets and I just go from one to the next.I'm not sure if my explanations of why I read more on the Kindle version is accurate (I'll leave the details for amazon's usability experts to study), but I do notice the same phenomenon with my Kindle version of The New Yorker, where I abandoned the print version altogether.Speaking for myself, I'm getting a lot more bang for the buck with the Kindle subscription. Hence my willingness to tolerate the pricing.",A different view on pricing

H, a family friend, comes to the rescue by abducting her to keep her safe. And here's where the stupidity comes in. h, a supposedly smart business woman, has control issues and attempts to escape. How? By hiking down the mountain refuge just when the sun sets. Of course, H catches her. Duh! Then there's some tug of war of personalities. Stupid pride over prudence. h insists she has to go back to civilization. Anyway, they strike a deal. Falls in love. Goes back to the city. Villain comes in. H comes to the rescue again. H proposes but h still with baggage issues. And it's the ending that contributes some redeeming value to the heroine's character. But no epilogue which would have rounded up the closure really well.So that's the story. Is it interesting enough? It could have been if not for the heroine's annoying totally-not-smart actions.

2239,"~ 1.5 Kidnaping Stars ~Kidnapping Casey is book two in the Zorn Warriors series by Laurann Dohner. If your a fan of forced seduction then this book will work for you. I did not enjoy it. To close to rape for my liking.Unlike the first book Ral&#8217;s Woman where Ral shows a genuine affection and protective concern for his human, Argernon dose not show these qualities for Casey until much much later in the book. Argernon is entirely shellfish and demands that Casey stay; because he can&#8217;t live without her. He gives her no choice. The same seduction techniques that Argernon uses are just like her ex who was trying to forcer her, and she should have told Argernon and he should have backed off and gotten to know her without the bondage. It felt like a broken record with the seduction your body wants me ergo your heart does too. Around 30% into the book we get some action outside the bedroom which was a change, but other then that it&#8217;s all about Argernon not letting Casey go.If you like to read a series in order then I recommend this book, but in general if your into overbearing alien men who don&#8217;t have a clue about women&#8217;s rights and like to use sex as a weapon to get what they want then you&#8217;ll like this, otherwise I would not recommend this one.",Review Kidnapping Casey
2240,"I really enjoyed this book. The characters are vivid, the mythology of the paranormal universe it is set in is interesting and compelling, the romance is fulfilling and the sex is great. But there were hints of so much more that just didn't get to be fully explored.I'm giving this book 4 stars because I really had fun reading it- DESPITE the fact that there seemed to be a hell of a lot more to the story than what I got. The book is definitely a romance- and I always enjoy a good paranormal romance, but there was just so much ELSE going on that it was almost a shame to spend so much time focused on the attraction between our two characters.I can't wait to read the second book, but I find myself drawn into the greater context of the world and hope to get more from the next books than just the romance. Lots of questions are left unanswered and the author makes interesting interpretations of standard paranormal mythos. I'd love to know more...Bottom line- good book. The story itself is fun. The characters are likeable and strong. The universe is interesting. I just wish it was maybe a little longer so that I didn't have to settle for all the HINTING Ms. Somers did at the larger context. It would be great to actually sink my proverbial teeth into more than just the romance...I'd love to see this series follow Tristan and Kennedy on their adventures, but something tells me later books will feature a different romance each time. That won't stop me from eagerly awaiting each one though!",Hint... hint... hint...

Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.  I would have loved to read more of her work in a Star Wars setting.",Terrific!!!
2253,"I really liked the MC narrator James.  He was a man who had made mistakes - and continued to make them - but was fairly self aware.  I have loved Dickens since high school, so the story about the &#34;missing&#34; Christmas story was fascinating and Josh Lanyon did a wonderful job of weaving portions/excerpts from that (fictitious) book into his own.  I never realized what a market there is for rare books.  As usual, Lanyon's writing is flawless.  I always enjoy his style.  James' neighbor was an endearing (although sometimes annoying character) and watching James take to her, despite himself, was a sweet touch.  And the glow-in-the-dark, flavored condoms were awesome.  I do wish the story hadn't ended so abruptly; I did not have enough interaction between James and Sedgewick to fully believe in their love/HEA.",Another good holiday story from Josh Lanyon
2254,"I enjoyed the characters.  I read the others in the series for that reason. I could tell it was written by a man the way the characters were described. It kept me interested through out, but I have read better books.",Nice read
2255,Book moved rapidly. Ending was predictiblebut I really liked. The writer held your interest all the way through. Would recommend it,II Liked It
2256,"It is very rarely that I find a book that makes me not want to take care of my customers because I want to stay with the book.  I understood a great deal of the book and even though I am not into ""God"" stories, this one was able to hold up on its own when I skipped past those parts.  As a woman who has escaped an abusive relationship I was able to see the conflicts in Ruth when she was looking for ways to escape without more people getting hurt.  I liked the ways the author showed the conflicts she had with killing or not killing Rewis, with helping or not helping Bobby and the disappointment experienced every time she thought she escaped just to be caught again by Rewis.  The flashbacks were a little heavy but they did put some context into what she had been through and what she was feeling.  Her final self reflection and decision to start over was a good way to end the story, I felt completed and not wanting to know what was going to happen next.",I was mezmerized
2257,"The story was slow and spent so much time on the inadequacies, insecurities, and low self-esteem of the lead character Amanda that it killed the book for me. Amanda was loud and irrational, like a bull in a china shop.  None of the characters were likeable. I almost put the book down several times but kept reading in hopes that these hapless characters would finally do their jobs and investigate the murder before Nora went to prison for life.",Characters too emotional
2258,"Bobby Blackhawk and Cale Yancey have shared the dream of owning a small ranch since they met in Ag class in high school.  After a stint in the military they finally had the funds to make their dream a reality.  Their place is located in the Colorado mountains.  During snowstorms the route to town from their home is impossible.  Fortunately in lieu of a female during these times Bobby and Cale are more than compatible and have no qualms about helping each other out if and when the need arises.After catching her fianc&eacute; cheating on her again, Katherine Duvall makes the decision to escape the intolerable situation.  She leaves behind her engagement ring, grabs the rental car keys and drives off completely ignoring the bell staff's warning about driving without snow chains in the stormy weather - and that almost proved to be detrimental.Fortunately for Kate, Bobby and Cale are on their way home from town when they notice her vehicle and become concerned because it's obvious she isn't used to driving in snowy weather.  The men follow the other car for ten miles and just when they think she might make it and not slide off into the river it happens - her car fishtails and slides off the road into the freezing water.When it becomes obvious that Kate isn't thinking straight enough to save herself, Bobby goes into the water to rescue her.  It falls to Cale to get Bobby and the woman back to the truck and then to their home where he strips them all down and climbs into bed between them to use his own body heat to warm them up.  He just never anticipated they'd end up sharing so much more - though he certainly isn't complaining!Delilah Devlin's storylines never fail to pull readers into the story and SADDLED is no exception.  Bobby and Cale have very different personalities and expectations so it's extremely interesting how they respond both individually and together toward Kate.  Kate displays a vulnerability and honesty that really drew me to her.  Of course the sex scenes are scorching and adventurous with the perfect blend of emotional turmoil to ensure readers keep Ms. Devlin's name at the top of their `must read' list.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",4.5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies
2259,"I haven't read this whole series. I only read Zsadist's story, Lover Awakened, and became enthralled by him. I fell in love with his character. In fact, the entire reason I'm not going back to read the rest of the series is the way the author tells the story--there were so many other points of view in Zsadist's book that I felt it took away from the true romance being told. It appears to be her style and the book's not a romance, so there's nothing wrong with it. It just isn't for me. So, when I found out about this book, I had to have it. I adored this book. I loved getting the deeper look into him and I loved having that final closure for him, watching him truly heal from his wounds. Very sweet book. If you read any of this series, read Zsadist. This is a hero who will be with me for a long time. She told his story with an almost eerie realism that only made me fall in love with him. The wounded hero. Love love love it. Highly reccomend this one.",Loved it.
2260,"I just love K.A. Mitchell. This story may be short, but its great! Cade is a pierced, bad boy, a free spirit. Elliot is an uptight, do everything by the book, make no mistakes kind of guy. Until Cade brings out the naughty in him! This is a wonderful opposites attract story.",Excellent short story
2261,"I prefer mysteries that keep me guessing up to the explanation at the end, and I figured this one out by the end of the second chapter.  By that time I also didn't particularly care for the main character, though I liked her older son. I found the constant references to the missing husband rather irritating, especially since the author doesn't tell us who Alexi was until his mystery-shrouded name had been sprinkled through the text five times.  One reviewer liked the lack of explanations in the book, but I don't enjoy passages that make me feel like the author is trying to play games with my head.  If the character doesn't know something, I'm OK with not knowing it, but pages of gloomy ""Alexi is missing"" with no explanation of who he was to warrant this attention made me grouchy.  I skipped to the end to confirm my guess and didn't feel any need to fill in the missing chapters. Overall, the author uses words well, and I'm sorry that I didn't find the book more compelling.",Non-compelling
2262,"The whole premise of this story was pretty far fetched to begin with and the author just couldn't seem to get it together. The story felt disjointed and I honestly zoned out for several pages. Not to mention the whole paranormal aspect came out of left field for me, this could have been of course because I zoned out, but still it didn't fit for me. The writing was weak and the character development and story was pretty much non-existent, I get this is a short story but a decent writer can still create a complete story that flows in a limited amount of pages, and this author wrote a longer story than most naught nooners! Definitely not a story that left any sort of memorable impression, but it is free so read at your own risk.",Ehh I Sort of Zoned Out

2268,"I give this a solid three stars, because while it certainly has serious language issues, I enjoyed the storytelling.What I mean by language issues is that Scott Marlowe, like all too many writers, has a smaller vocabulary than he thinks he does, and tends to use words incorrectly because he doesn't actually know their meaning and they sound like the word he does mean. He doesn't always spell words correctly, either (he consistently writes ""scraping"" as ""scrapping""), and there were examples of ""it's"" for ""its"" and ""who's"" for ""whose"". His sentences sometimes have missing words, change number partway through, are grammatically incomplete or (often) have misrelated participles.All these are issues that a good editor would fix. What's harder to get right is an enjoyable and engaging story, and while Marlowe hardly breaks new ground with this generic secondary-world fantasy, he does tell his story well and avoids the worst cliche of the genre: a Chosen One on a quest to save the world.The issues the characters bring with them made them a little more rounded, and while the plot is occasionally driven by someone doing something stupid, it's always understandably stupid and not (as is so often the case with books like this) unbelievably stupid.With a good editor, and preferably a little more originality in the worldbuilding, this could be a writer to watch.",Editing issues but a good story

I loved this story because it takes place in an entire town of shifters. That's right, almost everyone is a shifter and you can't even find the town unless you are some how connected to it. Like Rachel, her aunt died and she's come to town for the reading of the will. Rachel doesn't realize it, but she's a special kind of shifter, like her aunt, she can choose which animal she turns into. Burke is the leader of his own pride and doesn't yet have a mate. Rachel's aunt was the keeper of the totem, which protects the town and helps keep outsiders out. Together, they must find the totem and find each other in the process.

2284,"The story line of this book had the potential of being a dark thriller. Instead, it was a third rate novel with poorly thought out development and pedantic dialogue. With a mix of a serial killer seeking revenge, conspiracy by respected members of society, and a lack of authenticity as far as the criminal and legal justice systems work the result is a novel lacking any degree of actual thought. The author slips into very formal language at times, and the use of words and phrases that are more Great Britain then the U.S shows there was little research not only into the books' subject matter, but the setting as well.",Disappointing
2285,"**Possible Spoilers** If I had to review this book in one word it would be 'ridiculous'.  I had high hopes the first few pages as the initial crime unfolded.  I went into it willing to suspend belief about a model using that profession as a cover for her real job as a CIA agent.  When I read Jaclyn's back story about her parents and her near blindness I thought, ""Hmmm...this is intriguing.""Before too long though it became apparent that this book was going to fail due to cartoonish bag guys, silly superhero type gadgetry, and a plot whose holes you could fly a plane through.What could have been an interesting thriller was anything but.  The villain of the piece was presented immediately.  A mystery surrounding who murdered the 46 people with poisoned bottled water would have been engrossing.  Instead, super baddie, (and comically sociopathic) Grant Chillings is dumped into the reader's lap.I kept waiting for a clever explanation for his horrible deeds and how, exactly, he planned to gain the monopoly on the bottled beverage industry but it never materialized.  His end game was that he was going to add poison to his competitor's products and the local water supply, thereby forcing people to drink his bottled water or nothing at all.  He wasn't going to get caught or prosecuted for his crimes because he was justified in commiting them and the government wouldn't dare touch him.  I'm no expert, but I believe that narcissists feel justified in their actions, but they aren't patently stupid.When he murdered the entire Board of Directors of his company I was thinking, ""You don't think somebody might notice you did that?""Then we come to our heroine.  Again, this could have been a very interesting character, but failed miserably.  We are asked to believe that the government could only spare one inexperienced CIA agent and a 'watchdog' for her after 46 people die from poisoning and later 9 children are hospitalized in another attempt.  That's how the government would react to terrorism?When Agent 'Snapshot's' partner is eventually killed she is told by the director of the CIA that she'll have to 'go it alone' since they can't spare anybody else to help out with the investigation.  Riiiigggghhhht.The rest of this tale consists of Jaclyn running around in a skin tight black jumpsuit that is equipped with special spy toys, using her custom made spy Porche to wage war on Grant Chilling's laughable 'army' (in one of Boston's main government buildings, no less), and the female President of the United States using Boston's Duck Boats to storm the villain's lair.  If it sounds stupid that's because it is...painfully so.Also, the author's insistence on describing Jaclyn's profuse sweating as she runs around Boston in her spy suit and trenchcoat became sickening.One surprise bright side to this book was the unintentional comedic factor.  I found myself chuckling at several of the more absurd parts such as Jaclyn's mercurial response to different situations, which I can't imagine any self respecting CIA agent indulging in.  Also, the idea of government sanctioned destruction of city property (including missiles launched from Jaclyn's car) had me laughing and shaking my head.Most amusing were the spy toys Jaclyn had at her disposal.  The unfortunate part is that none of them really helped her.  With the exception of her body armor and the security system evading app for her iPad, the bad guys still kept getting the jump on her.For a woman who was trained to use all her senses in deference of her very poor eyesight and who was required to take out several Navy SEALS as a part of that training; she was amazingly inept at defending herself.I considered giving this book 2 stars because it had potential, but decided that it merited only one because of its blatant waste of a good story line.",Rambo Meets Heidi Klum Meets Inspector Gadget

2287,"The premise was good, the humor very good..and the romance..WHAT? Ok, I know this is a mystery..but there really is no excuse for making your main character fall in love in like 14 seconds. Honestly, that was so unbelievable it made the rest of the story hard to get into. Also, is there any point where the main character was not completely always perfectly right or on time? It's like there was no real nail-biting or clue hunting needed..since it was all conveniently contrived to plop in the main characters lap each time. Need a way for the evil character to find the hiding main characters? Make hims conveniently the BF of a biker chick who just happens to know where they are hiding. Really? That's your brilliant solution to this? Oy. The story has a lot of underlying promise..but it needs to get grittier and more Private detective-esque (IE no simple solutions and taking the easy way out of the tight plot..trust me..it will make you a better writer)",I like the premise
2288,"(Originally posted on SnarkyMomReads)""FERAL DOMINATION"", by T. A. Day, is the first of (currently) four books of the Faldron Shifter series.  As of this writing, it is being offer as a freebie at Amazon.  Typically when I see something published by Ellora's Cave I jump on it; their writers are normally 'safe bets' and really - if it's free, what does it hurt to try out a new author?Um, famous last words.In the overall scheme of things, the storyline was very good & deserves about a 4.5 star rating.  Gionne and Jenna are childhood playmates that become sweethearts with plans to mate - even though he is lupine and she is feline.  (In other words - they want to see if cats & dogs CAN play well together...)  Due to his father's illness, Gionne pushes Jenna away and she is NOT understanding of this and turns her back on him.  Fast forward a few years and she is asked to be a ""guest"" at Gionne's compound while the lupines grant the felines some much needed land to hunt on.  This story has REALLY REALLY HOT sex scenes - menage & anal are some, so you are warned! - and lots of miscommunication due to some betrayals by one of the pack members.What this story doesn't have?  Descriptive communication.  At times I felt like I was reading stilted, Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator style dialogue.  It was driving me nuts.  (NOT - ""It was driving me nuts!"", she exclaimed emphatically.)  Like I said, though, this is the first of the series (published in 2009) and is over 300 pages.  I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that as the author got into the series, the dialogue flowed a bit more easily.Hey - it's a free trial right now.  Doesn't hurt to try, right?  And if you really like shifter romances - this could be the start of one of your favorite series!  YAY!",FERAL DOMINATION - TERMINATOR STYLE!
2289,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***I don't even know where to start, I had so many issues with this book.1. Feels like it was expanded from a novella length.  There's an over abundance of repetition, both in content and words (pu$$y, no, bred/breeding, essence, no, virgin barrier, beast/monster, no, c@nt, no, no...).2. World building is lacking, the MC's are supposedly not human (and the last of their species) but very little information is given...and what little we learn is not a plus (squicky courtship rituals and child sex).3. Back to the child sex elements.  Call it fantasy/dreams/alien norm, it's still disgusting.  I'm sorry, but there's no way to pretty this up and make it acceptable or attractive...but the author kept attempting to beat that dead horse.4. The Heroine. The reader is provided enough fodder to write essay on the many ways this heroine is not likeable.  By the 1/3 mark I had an overwhelming urge to just slap the brat, and by the 2/3 mark I'm actively rooting for the heroine to die so the hunky hero can move on and get himself a real woman. Her only attractive qualities are physical, and the poor hero is doomed to a lifetime if misery bonded to this neurotic, indecisive, self-centered, potentially psychotic, twit.5. ""C@ck Tease"" - Yet another unlikable heroine characteristic. This term was mentally flashing above my head in bright neon colors almost the entire time I was reading (eventually skimming) this book.6. Non-consent/rape elements mentioned in other reviews? Not really how I would describe it (see item #5).  There's a number of sexual situations where the heroine says no, the hero pressures for further intimacy, she says no again (and obviously doesn't mean it and encourages him again), more pressure, and she capitulates.  I think the author may have been aiming for a borderline non-consensual feel, but it fell flat.  And personally I found it all more annoying than titillating, but other readers may feel otherwise.7. Incest...where?  The MC's lived together for a few years as adopted siblings, over 17 years ago.  No blood relationship whatsoever, and given the time frame involved this didn't trip my personal incest squick.8. At least two elements I felt were given too much emphasis (bordering on OCD) were her virginity and the brother/sister relationship.  Heroine wrestled with this almost every page...ad nausium.8. There is sex in werewolf form, it you find this offensive...just another reason to avoid this book.9. The fiance...what to say?  This entire aspect of the story just didn't work for me.  Why was she engaged to this guy, why did he put up with her, she didn't plan any portion of her own wedding, she ended it very badly and he morphs into a sex criminal...WTF.Bottom line...my urges to slap the heroine were multitude.",Lame in so many ways

The warden would have been a great guy to spend more time on, but alas it was not to be.I really liked the writing style of this author though. It had great flow and the premise of the book was great. How he made such a narrow subject matter so interesting, shows what a great writer he is.I was a little disappointed in the ending, and thats what put me off the story. It seemed to be a rehash of a lot of other tales. The person wakes up. Its always an easy out ,for a writer. Tired of writing it? Just say the person was dreaming, and bam, the story is over.

Also, the martial arts scenes were very well done. I am looking foreward to more books being added to this series. I have found that Mr. Sides is an excellent story teller. The characters become better defined with each book. If you do not enjoy action and adventure, with an apocalyptic twist, this is not the series for you.

2305,"This was the first book I read by Tonya Ramagos. I really loved the heat between the characters, the sex was good and the characters were interesting.I'm a little something of a badge bunny so I just loved seeing the fireman as the hero. Great book and an even better start to the series.",My first Tonya Ramagos book

2307,"This book was not good to me! It honestly was a waste of a sequel and the other reviews I read were right about the introduction of new characters. I too found myself hurrying through the pages of the new characters to get to old ones. I hated the ending it defeated the whole purpose of a sequel.**********SPOILER ALERT**********I hated that Vida died Tia not so much because she was destined to die with the way she was living life. But, Vida couldn't catch a freaking break EVERYTIME you turned around the moment things looked up for her something bad happen. This series should of ended with book one when Vida and Moe-Moe' s marriage because all that happen to Vida she deserved this. So this is why I have the book 2 stars.",Not Worth It
2308,"I adore a good D/s story, get wet with erotic spankings and really pant when presented with dubious consent. The only thing I liked about this book was the narration. It was told from the perspective of the alien, trying to tame his human pet. That, I thought, was very well done. I did not find this a love story. I did not feel any sort of pull toward any of the characters, and this did not push any of my erotic buttons; At ALL.I would suggest you only TRY this book if you really love age play, if you get hot imagining bruised and welted behinds, if heavy handed punishments (the vast majority of which were totally uncalled for) make you pant, then this is your book and boy oh boy will you love it!I guess because I actually do train animals, and know that punishments will not only NOT work, but take you further from your goal-and that goes with human children too- that I found this book irritating at best and abusive at worst.",Why did I believe the reviews?

2310,"I  loved Cry Sanctuary. I read this book in a couple of hours. My only complaint is that I wish the book was longer. Because the book isn't that long, the relationship between Keith and Abby developed rather quickly. Keith is the typical Alpha male. He's strong and responsible. Abby is a newly turned female who needs a strong male. Her attraction to Keith was instantaneous. I loved that Abby's character wasn't wimpy or whiny. Of course they are going to be good together. The sexual tension between Keith and Abby is palatable. But in typical hero fashion, Keith tries to do the right thing by resisting Abby and letting Abby make an informed choice on who will be her Guide.Cry Sanctuary has the typical elements of a werewolf story - at least werewolf stories that I've read. There's the Alpha male leader of a pack that doesn't follow the rules and treats the women badly. The alpha male from a neighboring pack has to step in and rescue the woman. In this case, two women - Abby and her sister Brynn. I'm looking forward to the second book which is about Abby's sister, Brynn.",Great start for the series

2312,"Out of Bounds was a quick, fun read. Kasey Johnson is a professional basketball player, and his twin, Garrett, is a famous Hollywood actor. Both are gay, Garrett is out but Kasey isn't. As the story opens, Kasey is back from an out-of-town game, and Garrett wants him to go out to a local club with him - Garrett has just broken up with his long-term partner and wants to go have fun.Ingram (Gram) Fletcher owns the Liverpool, the club near Kasey's home. Gram has had his eye on Kasey forever, but doesn't know if Kasey is straight or gay so he hasn't made a move. When Garrett and Kasey get to the club, one of their friends casually mentions to Gram that Kasey's in the back of the club and hints that Kasey might not rebuff advances from Gram. Then Garrett hints at the same thing. Deciding to take a chance, he heads over to see Kasey, and makes his move...and is rewarded with an enthusiastic response from Kasey.Kasey and Gram decide to get together again, and begin dating. Since Kasey is ""in"" and Gram is ""out"", it does make things a bit difficult. Kasey can't afford a hint of of the truth getting out as the sports world is nowhere near as accepting as Hollywood is, and rumors already swirl about Kasey's sexuality due to his twin being openly gay.When Kasey and Grant get together for a weekend in New Orleans, things don't go as planned and Kasey has to take a stand...My thoughts: First of all, you know I'm a sucker for any book that takes place in part or whole in New Orleans :) I really did enjoy Out of Bounds though. Kasey was a sympathetic character (I seem to always sympathize with the ones in the closet, I guess, lol) and Gram was understanding of his situation. I find in a lot of the M/M stories the partner that is openly gay gets frustrated with the partner that is not; that Gram wasn't pushing Kasey was a refreshing change.I had a bit of trouble with the opening scene - Kasey is very closeted and when Gram approached him in the club they started making out in public. I found that hard to believe, even if they were in the back of the VIP area. Except for that scene, though, I thought TA Chase did a great job with describing the setting and characters, and I could picture the events unfolding in my mind as I read along. Kasey's homophobic teammates were hateful and I was glad he also had supportive teammates in the locker room.I'm looking forward to reading his brother Garrett's story next - High Line.",Out of Bounds

2314,"Absolutely one of the worst mysteries I've read - well, the mystery was not all that bad, but the writing was very vanilla.  By that I mean: fairly simple sentences and almost no interesting, imaginative adjectives.  About half way through, I was bored, and I ""paged forward"" to the end just to see who the murderer was.  A surprise - which is the only reason I gave it two stars.  Further, I could not figure out how the perp knew where the to-be victims were and how to get at them.  Maybe that was in the part I skipped.","Mediocre mystery, vanilla writing."

2317,"It took me several tries to actually get into this book, but once I got started I liked the characters and was at least starting to develop an interest in them and their relationships.  However, the book leaves you hanging as none of the story lines are resolved.  For this reason I gave it only two stars.  It seems less than fair to me to write a book with several different plot lines and not tie up any of the loose ends.Unfortunately, I don't really care enough about the characters to run right out and purchase the next installment either.  After all, who knows haw many installments I'll have to buy to get to the end of the story.

I am a firm believer in no relationship do-overs but after reading this story, there might be an upside to second chances.",Intriguing read!
2319,"Ok, so I really liked the story, it's what kept me going through the book.  However, the 'relationship' between Charlie and Lynx made me feel...sad.  Lynx really likes Charlie - you can tell from the very beginning.  Lynx is Xorn and humans are extremely prejudiced towards them.  Xorn are thought to be little better than animals and very dangerous.  Charlie believes all of this.On one hand, I can say that it's a very simplistic way of creating tension between the H and h.  But being bombarded with all of that ridiculous (on Charlie's part) prejudice left me feeling kind of hollow and tainted the romance/HEA for me.I've just discovered this author and will try one or two other books to see how EA uses conflict in her other stories.",3.5 - somewhere between 'it's ok' and 'I liked it'

2321,"Jennifer Saints cobbled together a series of sex scenes and called it a romantic mystery.Thirty minutes before her wedding, the heroine is given a set of pictures showing her groom-to-be engaging in sex with a group of women.  Naturally, she calls the wedding off, and as she is fleeing the scene, still wearing her wedding dress, who should appear but her teenage crush.  She hasn't seen him for twelve years, but he whisks her away, and they proceed to have sex as often as possible, preferably nude and outdoors on the deck of the hero's beach house.  It goes without saying that every time they have sex, it's better than the last time.  Unfortunately, there's nothing there that we haven't read before, dozens of times, and that scene with the melted chocolate has been done so many times it was embarrassing to read it again.The book could also do with a good copy editor.  It's riddled with mistakes like ""daring-do"" for ""derring-do"", ""me and you"" instead of ""you and I"", and the hero wanting the heroine ""bad"" not badly.  They are a real distraction from what little plot there is.Ms. Saints has done her homework, and manages to include almost all of the cliches for this genre.  The heroine's family is rich and evil.  The hero's is poor and good.  His mother is a Wise Woman who rules her family of wild men with the iron hand in the velvet glove.  Unfortunately, she has a lot of children, so this series can run on for a long time.Evidently, the paperback edition has some photographs in it that are supposed to enhance the story (such as it is).  They aren't in the Kindle Fire version, so I can't say anything about them.I got this book as a freebie, and it was over-priced.  I would only recommend it to someone who is desperate.",Glad It Was Free
2322,"I downloaded this book thinking I would read it in one sitting. However, that was not the case. I found it juvenile and could not finish it. Wasn't worth my time. Should have been listed as a silly Harlequin romance because that is what I got out of the few chapters that I read....",Ho Hum

2326,"This is a difficult subject for a novel as it includes euthanasia and disabilities. However the subjects are treated sympathetically. It starts with a journalist, whose grandmother is dying, wishing to write a story about the clinic where she has spent her last days. It is soon apparent that all may not be as it seems and the reader is left in doubt as to whether the clinic is trying to help people end their days peacefully or there is an ulterior motive and the story changes to more of a medical mystery with the central character trying to get to the bottom of what is going on. The story is fast paced and you get a real feel for the characters particularly with the journalist's disabled girlfriend. At the end a decision needs to be made and the reader is left to think which way the story is going to go. I think the story ends with this moral dilemma but there are enough strings left hanging for there to be as sequel, if there is, I will read it.",A difficult subject

2330,"I enjoyed this book, especially when the price was so low.  My only complaint would be that if you were not paying attention, all this time was passing by from one chapter to the next.  I had to go back and re-read it carefully to figure out that time had transpired from one event to the next.  Story is about Blake and Josephine, who knew each other from when they were teenagers.  She apparently had a crush on him and he never knew.  After highschool, he left the town and became a very rich, successful venture capitalist.  She grows up and becomes a fairly famous model.  Many years later, they run into each other at a party and they are instantly drawn to each other.  They begin to talk and to dance, soon things get heated and they indulge in a passionate one night stand.  After that, Blake leaves her without a word and doesn't attempt to contact her.  Josephine is disappointed and hurt, so when she found out he had gotten engaged, she married his cousin Luke shortly thereafter.Fast forward to a year, Josephine comes home and realizes her husband has left her. Blake goes to her and tells her what his cousin said before running away and she realizes she has nothing.  He took all her money.  Feeling destitute, Blake offers her a job and a roof to stay in.  They begin working together and she soon realizes she is good at the job.  Meanwhile, the attraction is still there and many months go by apparently.  One day they just can't take it anymore and become involved again intimately.  Will thire past get in the way? Will her feelings of betrayal and hurt resurface?  Can they make it into more than a fling?Story moved way too quick for me personally.  Character development was a bit lacking and you had to take things at face value, instead of living it as most good stories do.  Overall, quick and light reading, not in my keep pile.",3.5 stars for this short story...
2331,"While Silent Blade is quite a short story, it's written with a surprising depth and emotion that I found appealing. I'm rather amazed that Ilona Andrews managed to combine such interesting world building and character development in such a short vehicle...though maybe I shouldn't be, as I'm a tremendous fan of her writing style. I am also surprised at how much I enjoyed this, as alternate universe fiction with a science fiction theme is by no means a preferred genre of mine. This was a pleasant little read that I enjoyed very much, and while I can see how expanding this into a full-length novel would definitely appeal to the fans of the genre, I think it may have been a little too much for me to really enjoy. This short story format worked very nicely for me.",Short But Satisfying

There was a fair amount of sex that was agreeably portrayed, although somehow not super exciting.  it seems like a majority of erotic stories have sex scenes that are boring or use too much crude language or have no real feeling in them.

2337,"You Can Leave Your Hat On is what the title promised, a naughty little novella on a stripper and his lover. The starting point of the story is one I already see in the past, a young and handsome College TA, Harlan, who has the hots for his even more handsome, a slightly older, College professor, Sawyer. The book respects the rules of a May / December romance plus the College setting with an Office Affairs theme... the shorten the thing, this is the classical romance by the rule, with the twist of being a gay romance. So I would say that it can appeal both to the old fan of the gay romance than to a newbie who wants to try her hand on the genre.Being Sawyer older and also Harlan's superior, he has all the trouble of the case: he can't take advantage of his position, he doesn't want to be involved with a younger man who can have everyone he wants, and plus there is also a little problem of appropriateness... Harlan to make the ends meet has a side job as a stripper in the local gay club, and Sawyer saw him at his workplace. So the point if Sawyer is gay is no more a question, but now there is the biggest problem that, even if Sawyer manages to move on the fact to have a relationship with a student, the fact that said student is a stripper is a big NO for the career of a college professor.And so Sawyer didn't make a move on Harlan, stopped to go to that club, and forced himself to have a strictly professional relationship with the boy. Only that Harlan is not of the same idea, and as soon as he reaches his graduation day, he is also ready, willing and naked for the professor to take. Harlan has all the cockiness of his young age, he is really convinced that Sawyer is avoiding him only since they have a professional relationship to preserve, and he thinks that, as soon as that problem is over, Sawyer will be all his to take. In a way I like how daring and careless Harlan is, but this only proves that he is really young.Being Harlan one of his students, it's not the only problem for Sawyer; there is also the question of his side job, as a stripper, that is not exactly a good visiting card to prove his willingness to commit and being exclusive; and then even if Harlan wants a real relationship, it's not said that Sawyer wants the same thing: he is arrived at an age where or you start to think seriously to commit, or you run at the minimum hint that there is a chance to be shackled... There is quite a controversy inside Sawyer, he is jealous of Harlan, mainly due to his job, but he is also skittish when it's time to commit and give something real to Harlan. Where Harlan is open and maybe careless, at least he has his mind clear and he knows what he wants... for all the years Sawyer has more than Harlan, he has not yet reached that level of maturity.Anyway this is a novella, mostly and erotic novella, with a lot of sex scenes, hot and nice, and all in all it spans only two days in the life of our characters, so there is not enough time to develop a lot, but I have the idea that the author has something more in mind, since she introduced some supporting characters (Harlan's brother, Rhys, and Sawyer's friend, Macon) that have too much deepness to be only a passing spectator.",You Can Leave Your Hat On by Lena Matthews
2338,"This was a pretty good book by Evangeline Anderson. This book had BDSM elements, which I don't usually read or get into, but it wasn't too heavy for jarring which I appreciated.The premise of the story is of two sisters who are a year and a few weeks apart, but who are complete contrasts of one another. Sabrina Markes is the younger of the two, svelte in size, and is one who takes full advantage by her show of immaturity and lack of common sense or awareness of others. Jillian is the older sister who has always had to watch out for her sister and bail her out of trouble countless times throughout her sister's life. She is also plus size (a size eighteen) and is very insecure about her size, especially when she has a size 2/3 sister to constantly compare herself two.An interesting parallel in this book is that we are dealing with two sets of siblings. Adam, who happens to be the owner of We Kidnap U - a business that provides a service to fulfill any woman's fantasy, is the younger brother of Kyle, who is a carpenter. Sabrina ends up buying into her fantasy which would be fulfilled by Adam, but he ends up needing to leave town for a convention and forces his brother to cover this one job. Kyle begrudgingly agrees to cover this one job and ""kidnap"" Sabrina and fulfill her fantasy. However, flakey as she ever is Sabrina changes her mind and sails out of town herself with her man of the moment, and tells her sister Jillian that she would cancel her kidnapping. But that does not end up happening.Kyle ends up kidnapping Jillian, for he believes her to be the client Sabrina but is pleasantly surprised not only by her beauty but of her curvaceous size, which turns him on. He them goes on to submit Jillian to Sabrina's elaborate fantasy.This wasn't a long read, but I liked how we got to see the inner dialogues of both main characters. It was heavily on Jillian's thoughts and from her perspective, but I appreciated the back and forth. I also thought that she was fast to submit, but since that was a desire of hers I guess that makes sense. And I liked the HEA that Ms. Anderson applies to a lot of her books.",Pretty Good

Kelly and Jae knew each other better than they thought they did thanks to those emails, otherwise I would be saying the sex and &#34; love you's&#34; came too fast.

Yes, Will was abused but Kelly didn't know about it until after sex had pretty much stopped between them. Also, Will mentioned wanting someone to &#34;save&#34; him, and maybe Will saw Kelly as that person and found comfort and not resentment in the nature of the relationship.I would have liked to see more of Jae's family, just for te humor of all of the angry Asian women he talked about... would have lightened up the book some. It had its angst, but nothing I felt was overplayed. The feelings were organic.I did become slightly... fed up with the on-again off-agin part. One thing would arise and one of them would run off, and a few weeks later they were together again... maybe three or four times. It got a little old.I did enjoy the humor of the book, though Will's title as &#34;all around slut&#34; was a little too raw.The characters were all ther own, and I absolutely loved Will.

Working at the Chicken Ranch, a rural brothel that caters to women and gay men, seems like the perfect solution.

Killian Hamilton is sweet and kind, with a stutter Declan can't help but find adorable. Surely, if anyone could overlook Declan's choice of employment, it would be a kindhearted man like Killian.But Declan didn't figure on Killian's connection to one of the brothel's regular clients, and now his love life's about to blow up in his face.Review:Chicken Ranch: Hunger, is the first book in the Chicken Ranch series. When Killian's best friend tells him of an all male brothel, catering to men and women, he first decides it's not for him. Finally giving in, Killian decides to give it a shot.After being kick out of his dad's house for being gay, Declan is homeless man and looking for any sort of work when he learns about The Chicken Ranch.When I first met Declan, I was so worried about him. The poor man hadn't eaten in a while, and he's turning to a brothel for work. In many ways, this story could have ended badly for him. I was drawn into his character from page one.I think Killian was a perfect match for the young virgin. He was sweet and caring from the start. As much as I enjoyed this book, I kept waiting for some big explosive scene. I mean, there was a misunderstanding of sorts, but everything seemed to be smoothed over rather quickly. My only other complaint...there wasn't much background about the brothel. It was like it magically appeared. I feel like I missed something on this accept.The sex scenes are very well written! This isn't my first Amanda Young story, so I was really looking forward to the connection between the characters in the sheets. SO not a let down there!I give this book 3 Stars. I think it is well written and the series has great potential. It just missed that spark for me. I'm really looking forward to reading book two.","Review: Chicken Ranch: Hunger (Chicken Ranch, #1) by Amanda Young"

2351,"Co-themes of this book: continual same-sex rape and bondage along with describing the changing of a female human into a vampire like a dog in heat (including a heat scent) where constant sexual release would dull the pain.

2354,"In a sort of Romeo and Juliet spirit, Sydney (Juliet),  from a hunter family, falls in love with Jason (Romeo) a werewolf. She has dreamed of him over the years and meeting Jake in person, she falls in instant lust. They consume their relationship pretty quickly and he bites her, therefore starting her transformation into a full-fledged werewolf.Meanwhile, her father keeps trying to get her to hunt and kill werewolves.The hunters, who know full well the wolves they are trying to kill are human, are shown as uneducated rednecks, whose collective IQ is less than 100. The werewolves are not much better. Why they would want to run wild in the woods when they know they're in danger is never quite explained. One would think that they would have leaned to control their instinct in order to survive. Or at least do something to stop the hunt (politics, law-making and media relation anyone?)But there's worse. The relationship between Sidney and her father is unhealthy and made me cringe. She's an immature little girl looking for Daddy's attention and he does not listen nor takes her feelings seriously.

The hero is gorgeous, fierce, conflicted...and shows loyalty forged by a will of iron. The heroine, on the other hand, wasn't my favorite character. Her prolific promiscuity was a turnoff for me. Yes, she had her reasons, but they just didn't seem plausible enough for me. Others may not care.

I say that because I'm not really a fan of the ""famous person"" fantasy so I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the other two stories. Maddie, awestruck and helpless, falls under superstar Tanner's emotional and sensual spell...blah blah blah. Flying her out to see him? Buying her jewellery?

2367,"This was a different ""end of the world"" synopsis. No zombies, pandemic, or virus. You can guess- it is a fog. The  children grow up as young adults in this book, which I found wonderful! A refreshing read. You will see the endurance of the human spirit and can easily see what could happen in these circumstances. Not the ""fog"", but if any children were left to their own devises for a long period of time.Several people have made negative statements about a kid of 16 pairing with another, about age 27 years old. That would not be uncommon in this type of setting. The amount of people in this story are limited. Also, sexual desires often takes precedence over what would be considered normal.

2373,"Stuff on a Stick pretty much says it all.  Essentially, it's a set of instructions on various things you can put on a stick.  Nothing particularly thrilling either--it just didn't translate well to a book OR Kindle format, instead remaining like an Instructable of the lesser kind.  It might be interesting to an adolescent who wants to create something in the kitchen, but for anyone who would like to replicate the fair foods that so many people have a secret fondness for, it's a total loss.I can't really recommend this book for anyone who is capable of making even the most basic recipe.  It's almost more like putting together a paper model than cooking.  It was a fast read though--about ten minutes, and I'd reached the end and wondered why I'd wasted the whole ten minutes.","This ""stuff on a stick"" wasn't worth downloading"

2375,"And a little too often this novella crossed the line.  And, if I am being honest, I have to agree with the reviewer who said the Amazon blurb covers the entire story.  It does:  Ryan shows up at his sister's wedding after being threatened and kicked out by his parents; she welcomes him back with open arms and his childhood friend that he had a crush on protects and takes him in.  There's some explicit sex, and Ryan and Dan the standard sensitive bottom and alpha male protector, respectively.  So, why are there so many positive reviews?  Sometimes a reader just wants a simple ""happily ever after"" and this satisfies on that level.  No, it's not Shakespeare, or even a particularly original romance.  But, it is not the worst gay romance I have read and it didn't set me up for a great story and fail to deliver.  My expectations were low.  I wanted something with some sex and an HEA to while away the time while waiting for my plane.  I don't regret reading it, but it wasn't memorable either.  It was worth the price of an e-book.The lack of actual conflict or tension actually inspired me to read the sequel,To Keep and To Love, to see if the author develops the relationship or builds a plot.  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high and I was disappointed.",Fine line between romance and sap
2376,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble, this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night, the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time, (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner",entertaining insightful look at the south
2377,"4.5 StarsCatherine Cullen-Wellesley is devastated when her husbands forget their date to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary, thus also ruining the surprise she had for them. At least they still had their upcoming two week vacation to Jamaica where they would have some much needed time uninterrupted. When Logan and Rhys postpone that to jet off on a last minute business trip, Catherine has to face the facts that her marriage is in serious trouble. Desperate for some time to think, she decides to go on that vacation without (telling) them. When Logan and Rhys return home to find her gone, they realize they're on the verge of losing the woman they love. Not willing to let her go without a fight, they chase after her and spend the next two weeks trying to gain her forgiveness as well as her trust.This story was an emotional roller coaster ride fro beginning to end. At first it was easy to side with Catherine. She's felt neglected for a long time, more so since Logan and Rhys began building their company from the ground up. Then we get glimpses into the minds of Logan and Rhys, and it becomes apparent that they love Cat beyond measure. They're not bad, just oblivious. When they finally catch up with her, they don't waste any time trying to convince her she's still their number one priority. However actions speak louder than words, and act they do.Catherine accepts responsibility that she's partly to blame for the breakdown of their marriage because she never told them how she really felt whenever they put the company before her. I liked that Logan and Rhys acknowledged that they'd messed up. They didn't try to dictate her around or make her feel guilty. However, after we find out about their background and that their quest to be financially successful was as much for her as it was for them, it made Cat seem clingy, needy and selfish (but it could have been her pregnancy hormones adding fuel to the fire). Despite being on vacation with her, they still had a company to run, and they left without leaving instructions behind, so it really bothered me that she would tense up and get angry or fearful whenever they'd take a work call or work email. Before things get better, there's a misunderstanding and more drama for them to overcome. In the end I think they redeemed themselves by making compromises that seemed so simple. If only they had come to that conclusion sooner. Hindsight is 20/20 and I think their relationship only got stronger because of all the heartache.Though the love scenes were steamy, I found myself skimming them. They weren't bad, but I was just more invested in the characters and their personal growth as they tried to navigate the pitfalls of work and marriage. This was an excellent read.",Emotional roller coaster; will quest for success ruin a marriage?

2384,"I'm unfamiliar with this author, and I was really surprised at the depth she put into this short story. Right from the beginning, I could see how well-put together this story is, lots of descriptive detail, dynamic character and easy dialogue. I love short stories, and it's not that easy to take short fiction and pack it with substance and intrigue. This story is short but layered; there's some darkness to it, some magic and fantasy, and some seduction and scheming.The story is told in first-person from the POV of Sir Dardanus, but what makes that unique for me is that he's really an anti-hero, ""a bastard and ne'er-do-well, a murderer and a seducer of women."" Just what won't this man do in order to get what he desires? Even at the end, I was still a bit uncertain about what he'd actually do, and with the way the author left the final page, I have to wonder how or if this romance will continue. I choose to see hope and promise there, mixed with the darkness.This isn't a sweet, happy romance, Dardanus and his intentions a little too dark and moody for that. Also, I wouldn't say that this story is overly erotic (and I do think it needed to be more erotic in that detail), but certain aspects of the story do hold some sex appeal for me: the domination and surrender, the dark and complex hero, even the slightly rough sex scene and the tension behind it. Combined with the author's skill, all of those things produce an engaging short read and a hero who knows how to leave his mark. I want more of him.The Knife's Edge ends at location 366; the rest of the download is excerpts fromThe Fever and the FuryandPoisoned Kisses: Poisoned Kisses\Midnight Medusa (Harlequin Nocturne).","an engaging read, short but with depth, including a dark and delish hero"

Lily is the on-call girl for the weekend but Jane is required to help out before each event takes place, assuming she is not other wise engaged. It seems that the birthday boy Antonio has snagged her attention along with his BFF santos and they are keeping her completely distracted, so much so that she misses the breakfast brunch and the dinner sit-down. Read this book because just like the first book it's a scorcher. You will be wet from start to finish, and you won't want to miss reading book 3 or 4.",An Awesome Read!
2386,"I really enjoyed how this story developed.  Its a well-written Sci-fi depicting what happens when an alien race quietly tries to study earth and one of the members of the scientific team gets away from the group and is discovered by a human.  The world-building of the alien race was easy to follow since explanations came steadily throughout the story instead of one long monologue at the beginning.The characters' personalities and situations were established for some time before they actually come in contact with each other and then their relationship developed at a believable rate as they first had the culture/language barrier and then that period of just exploring their differences and similarities before it grew into something of a romantic nature.Not to say physical attraction wasn't there pretty soon after they met though Kent is a bear about it because he's recently sworn off women and here at his campsite remote from civilization he is joined by a female.Kent is a biology professor and scientist who was very athletic and rugged liking to bike and camp out far off the beaten path.  He is startled by Povre's differences when he first sees them, but soon adjusts to appreciating her exotic beauty and her sweet curious spirit.  Povre is of a race that has some psychic ability and she senses many things in Kent's emotions.  At first his anger frightens her, but then he becomes protective and kind.After getting over their mutual surprise, the rest of the story's action is about dogging all the government and non-government groups interested in capturing Povre for their own obvious reasons.  And at the same time, they grow closer knowing that Povre's people will probably come for her and they will be separated and there is always the fear that she'll be discovered and captured.From time to time, the story shifts to a third character, Povre's mission leader and father who was forced to leave her behind when she wandered away from their exploration group.  He follows protocol and gets the others back to their ship and safety even while despairing over his daughter's absence.  He knows that if she is captured, she will not be treated well.The plot held no surprises for me and it was simplistic, but that was fine with me because it allowed me to focus on the developing romance between Kent and Povre.  They really were good together.  He was trustworthy and strong for her while at the same time he was tender and understanding of what she was going through.  Povre helped heal Kent's bruised heart, gave him someone to protect and love as well as showed him the delights of discovering something for the first time when he watched Povre enjoy nature.  What I really thought was interesting is that though both are humanoid and share enough characteristics to be compatible, this truly is an alien romance.  They really saw each other's souls under all the surface differences.It was a nice read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a light Sci-Fi Romance.","When an Alien Scientist Gets Lost in the Oregon Wilderness And a Human Scientist Finds Her, Love Is Their Discovery"

2392,"Plot/Storyline: 5 StarsThis is the best Markhat ""story"" I have read so far. I put ""story"" in quotes because, although it's that way in the title, this is actually a novel.The plot was original with a gritty, noir setting. The fantasy world of Markhat was enthralling. Mr. Tuttle really knows how to draw the reader into a different world by showing the way things are, instead of just telling about it.The storyline moved at a fairly fast pace. There were some twists and turns that left me gasping, once even bringing a few tears. Although the book is filled with Vampires and other odd creatures, it is still a very `human' story.Although this book is part of a series featuring the character of Markhat, like the others, it can be read as a stand-alone.Character Development: 5 StarsMarkhat was a wonderfully deep character with an interesting past that was revealed in bits and pieces throughout the story. He was always `in character' with believable motivations.Mama Hog was also present in this installment. I was happy to see her again as she is the perfect companion and mother-figure for Markhat.The new characters introduced in this book were also very well-drawn. Each had their own motives and personalities, making them likable or easy to hate, as needed.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle was in his usual fine form. There was humor interlaced through even the most gruesome portions. The humor was sometimes blatant and, at other times, a bit obscure, but always there if a reader cared to look, and I did.The descriptions were vivid. The dialogue was snappy and in good form. Everyone spoke with just the right amount of accent to be believable and have a unique voice.

2402,"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.",Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced

2404,"Okay, so I read this story despite knowing that it was written by the author of ""Freeze"", a book I wasn't too fond of, and I am sorry to say I didn't like this one too much either. Here's why: First and foremost, like ""Freeze"", I found this story to be a bit juvenile, seemingly written for the preteen/teen crowd. Secondly, I dislike the author's fascination with the juvenile use of sex in this story; I mean really...two jerk (blank) sessions in one very short story accompanied by ongoing graphic references concerning semen and its various characteristics are a little much, don't you think??? There is the obligatory gore which seems to pervade this genre and, while some authors handle it well, this author overwrites his descriptive prose horribly. In addition, errors and omissions don't help garner higher ratings. Oh well, live and learn...perhaps the best tact for me is to simply stop giving this author other chances for redemption. I'll have to consider that. In the meantime...""SCRUBBING BUBBLES TO THE RESCUE""!",CLEANUP IN PLUMBING PLEASE...CLEANUP IN PLUMBING!
2405,"Day of Sacrifice: The Prophecy (Day of Sacrifice Stories #1) by S. W. Benefiel(Discloser: I received this eBook free in order to write a review)Summary:Flora is approaching her twenty first birthday.  That is normally an exciting time for a young woman, but Flora isn't normal.  She is the first born in her family and, therefore, is the family sacrifice to the Gods.  Her entire life has lead up to the day of her death.  Her sacrifice ensures the Gods blessings on her family.  Flora is a bit of a rebelled but she knows her duty.  She pushes the limits to the fullest extent but she knows what will happen on her birthday.  Her pure body (she's a virgin) will be sacrificed to the Gods.My thoughts: (Some spoilers)For a short story, this novella was packed with a lot of story.  An entire background was given for a society that contains supernatural beings (witches, werewolves, and vampires) as well as lowly humans.  Included with the background for the story, a short tale was included.  While I think that the background information was well done, I'm not sure that the characters were as well developed.  The story happened very fast and I was unclear why chances were taken.  Some of it seemed very convenient to the story.  The idea of sacrifices was clearly disliked by many characters in the story but it seems that it has gone on for quite a few years.  Such ingrained tradition doesn't get challenged on a whim.  There just wasn't enough story invested to make any kind of changes.  Clearly, I am implying that there is a challenge to the idea but I won't say any more about it.Personally, the book was too graphic with too many uses of the F word but if those things don't bother you, then you may like this book.  With all that said, I give this novella a 2 out of 5.",Too Short to really work well
2406,"I normally try to appreciate each author's voice and the story's individual tone, but none of this made sense to me. It went from sing-song to brutal -- or at least hints at brutal -- and I didn't follow much of anything in between. Bottom line: I'm bewildered.",Maybe I just don't get it.

2409,"This is one of those times where I wish we could score 1/2 stars, I would give 1 1/2 here.The author really tried, and as someone who has been trying to finish his own murder mystery, I applaud him for his work.However, the writing was so clumsy and awkward.I felt like I was reading a letter (and a poorly written one at that).  ""He said....and then she said....and I told them.""Show, don't tell - the primary rule of fiction writing - is what's missing here.  I feel like I was told a story and not shown one.The characters all have potential, but I did not feel like I got to know them because the clunky first person narrative (which switched to third a few times without warning) did not flesh them out.I love a good murder mystery series, but sadly, I can't bring myself to read anything more in this series.As for the mystery itself, the author pretty much handed the killer over to the reader without a lot of suspense.  No red herrings, nothing that made me second guess myself.  There was an interesting twist at the end, which I did enjoy.I love ebooks because they give everyone a chance to have their stories heard and I appreciate the effort, but this just did not work for me.",A For Effort
2410,"This is a really cute little story. I sat down and read it in an afternoon, and felt it time well spent on a rainy/snowy day. The characters were interesting. I liked the main male character, an Oregon professorial candidate specializing in the flora and fauna of Oregon. What was most interesting, though, was the concept of a race from the stars who are intelligent, gentle, and devoted to one another. Very nice. I know some were frustrated by the fact that Kent took to Povre so easily. Hey, get a grip, people! It is a story - a very sweet story of the most unusual kind of 'cross-racial' relationship. Extremely cross-racial, as in cross-species. But how is that any more questionable than the whole ""woman meets vampire/werewolf/demon/angel"" thing that is so popular these days? I love those, too! The idea that a human botanist/biologist could find an endangered alien and not want to cut her up? Pretty cool concept. Of course, as a scientific personality, I see the problems with the whole 'iron based vs. cobalt based' blood and genetic issues with the baby thing - but hey, as I said before, it is a sweet, simple, very positive story. Something I enjoyed a great deal.All in all, I am really glad that I caught a glance at it as a 'suggested read' for me and took a chance on it. I will absolutely look for more by this author.",Both creative and enjoyable

2417,"The premise (threesome-curious but unexperienced couple hires an escort to teach them about sex) had promise, but the writing was weird (as another reviewer noted, would the husband really need to remind his wife that they are both unexperienced?).  It was as if the author couldn't decide whether or not to write a realistic story or a fantastical one, so we got a bit of both and jarring between the two was weird.Realistic:  Yes, it is very difficult for a couple to find a female third to play with and hiring an escort probably is the quickest way to make it happen.Fantastical:  Said escort will probably not show up at your door naked below the waist and make all your fantasies come true without you having to tell her anything about what it is you actually want to do or discussing money.I would recommend this only if you can get it for free.","Premise had potential, but awkwardly written"
2418,So reading the blurb I thought racy story about two people trapped in a cabin. Sounds ok. What I wasn't prepared for was the sweet romance and good story.  Both  Genevieve and Alex have been hurt in the past. I liked the way Alex had such an open mind about Genevieve's special talents. He didn't try to explain them away or ignore them. Genevieve was much less excepting of her talents than Alex was. Being on her own for so long with major preconceptions about her past actions and character. It was great to see Alex blow her preconceptions out of the water.These two were down to earth and I liked seeing them get to know each other.  They saw each others supposed flaws and strengths so differently.  It was obvious they saw things in each other that hadn't been uncovered and would lead to change in the future.  This was the first book I read by Alisha Rai and I liked her style.  This book was a good mix of relationship building and steamy encounters. It was a standalone book and from what I can see she doesn't have any plans to turn it into a series. Which is fine sometimes it's just nice to read a great story!,Great book!
2419,"I will acknowledge that I haven't read a lot of Grace L. Hill's books.  First there were lots of typos as others have commented.

2420,"PJVs QUICKIE POV: I seem to be hungry as of late. {har har Primal Hunger get it???} For some reason my schedule has left me hiding under the covers with my kindle. Hence, all of the ebooks. Or was it my over-indulgence in YA? Had to jump out of the teenie-bopper realm and get me so down and dirty adult PNR. Whatever it is, I have fallen in love with Samhain Publishing and all of their paranormal picks. Primal Hunger is my latest conquest and it has me eager to read more of Somers' writings. An interesting concept, Somers pairs Arthurian legend with shape-shifters and gargoyles, didn't know this would make for smoking hot read...but isn't that what makes for great fiction?REVIEW: Kennedy, the hot bartender from Pendragon's with a sharp tongue and a penchant for trouble-making, has found herself in a situation. She's been hot for the co-owner for like forever, but he can barely stand her. So, when her car breaks down outside the club and he pulls up to assist her, she's not exactly wanting to be alone with him in fear that her hots for him might become evident.Tristan is the object of Kennedy's desires, but he is also a gargoyle shape-shifter and immortal to boot. He has been on a mission for a long time, to save his brother. He has no time for women, especially women like Kennedy. Why he stops he doesn't know - but instinct takes over and Kennedy is getting in his car - and then all hell breaks loose.Shot with a tranquilizer Kennedy has to save Tristan as they go on a break-neck run to save both of their lives. Doped up, with all inhibitions gone, Tristan finally lets his cat out of the bag and begins to seduce Kennedy - not like it was very hard. From that moment on, Kennedy's life will never be the same, hanging with immortals is not exactly good for a girl's livelihood.I really liked the concept of this book, I'm a sucker for Arthurian legend, even though it was just lightly touched upon. The book really didn't do much to explain a correlation between gargoyle cat shifters and the Knights of the Round table. But, this book actually did little explaining, because it really was more erotica than paranormal romance. So - Primal Hunger was smoking hot and a delectable kitty pounces unsuspecting human book, but again I would have liked to see more plot expansion. I feel I'm being critical though, because with the length of this novel and the story-line I believe it achieved what it set out to do - entertain and titillate.RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, this is an erotica novel. Fans of shifters should enjoy.",Arthurian Legend & Sexy Shapeshifters Oh My!

2425,"Inside every woman is a romantic. No matter how sophisticated one had become or how modern our world had turned out to be, a small part of us still believe in fairytales and Prince Charming.

Carson and Holly met in a club, which for lack of a better description is where couples hook up. And Carson and Holly hooked up alright. They just did not realize the consequences of their actions.And that is what makes this short story interesting. There is not a lot of conflict because it is a fantasy come true. The sex scenes pack heat but not actually sizzling. Holly and Carson are likeable and I wish that the book is at least a novella or better yet, a full novel.

I loved how Will's sweet shyness totally meshed with Jenny's outgoing personality. The story was well-paced and definitely kept my attention.  So, it's mostly all good.The only thing that bothered me was the assault.  Only because it seemed kind of forced and out of the blue.  I would have much rather had Will's secrets be revealed by him confiding them to Jenny in a different situation - including the fact that she was his first everything.

The summary had everything that I love in a romance:  alpha male, secret child, heroine that bounces back from heart break, not to mention the setting of the 80s and rock and roll.  Unfortunately, what I got for my $2.99 was a poorly written book with a controlling hero, a very silly heroine and an unrealistic success story.  I understand that Sandra Edwards is a very successful author, and I admit that I haven't read anything else by her, but this read as something I might have written in junior high school.

And I'm sorry to say that because I was pretty excited to get into this book at the very beginning.The world building was very basic and very poorly done. Like an outline, with no substance. There wasn't a lot of background about the witch, who she was, why she did what she did. No motive, no nothing. Just a bunch of sex, which was pretty good and half way decent, until I realized that was all there was going to be.I found myself wanting the book to end, which is really sad being that it was only about seventy pages long. The dialogue was really bad and so borderline cheesy that I found myself rolling my eyes near the end.And don't even get me started on the character development.

I am a French speaking person and I was more into the dictionary than the book itself.  But I loved it, it expend my vocabulary to the max.  Naturally, as a French speaking person, I sometime found it confusing; was it the language barrier or was it really difficult to follow.  So, I was glad when I read some reviewers saying it was confusing and all over the place for them too.  But I still appreciate this book tremendously.The book cover is very representative to the storyline.  This story has strong characters who bring interesting plots to the storylines with issues such as homelessness, sexual abuse, rape, torture, special abilities and paranormal; a story that is so unpredictable.This is a book/storyline where you need and open mind, this is not an easy read.  You need to go back few pages in order to catch the idea, the meaning of what you just read.  Even if the storyline is about Jesse and Sarah who are about 17 years old, this is adult material.  Is this reality or hallucination?  Is this reality or parallel planes?  I really enjoyed this book and I would tremendously enjoy a sequel.I just downloaded &#8220;Corvus&#8221; of the same author.

I saw some promise in Caleb and Van, but wasn't at all fond of Anne through the whole of the story. I'm not really sure why, but she got on my nerves, I'm sorry to say.

2446,"This is an interesting little novella at just over 200 pages, and is definitely something one would want to pick up if they are looking for something new to read.The storyline revolves around four characters and a cross-country road-trip which, in itself makes for an interesting read. Although the book is well written and intriguing, the length of the novella is not enough to give any in-depth and engrossing back story to the characters, and it is told through the words of the main protagonist. However, along the way, the Author manages to bring into the journey, so very interesting and very flawed sub-characters, which add to the tale very nicely. One thing the Author does achieve very well with the writing of his characters, is the feeling of their growth as the journey continues and they begin to learn things about themselves, and others, that they previously were unaware of; this gives a sense of reality to the characters, and also makes the reader wonder, how much do they actually know about the people they associate with, and is their view on the world they live in skewed by preconceptions.The journey they take is written in compelling and curious ways that makes you keep reading on to an almost realistic ending that keeps the feelings of practicality and realism that are written in to the novella throughout. The only issue I had with the Kindle version of this read were the typos that could have been picked up by a good proof-reader and/or editor, and this did detract from my enjoyment of this book.I would recommend this book to readers of Murakami Haruki, and other Japanese contemporary Authors.Originally reviewed on: [...]",Interesting little novella

Or they SERIOUSLY never look like the leads inside.  Or it looks like the cover of Penthouse.  Is there no honesty or a happy medium???  pfft.Okay.  Got that off my chest.  I like Paisley Smith but I never bothered ever reading the synopsis of this one due to the cover until I got REALLY interested in her work, lol.  Glad I did.  This is definitely one of my favorite Paisley couples.

Emily Granger is beautiful, wealthy, and blonde.  I love the classy way she is described and the fact that she hasn't been sexually fulfilled before.  Love an author who doesn't forget to give me a visual of her lovely legs.  Or her lovely skirt.  Or the way her hair falls about her shoulders.  I love these visuals.  Emily's femininity emanates right off the page... my favorite thing about Paisley's femmes.  They are genuinely feminine and delicate... and just passive enough to create a very delicious dynamic with a butch who knows how to take control.I can't get enough of her butch / femme couples when they are like these two.  It's what I liked about Beguiled.  And Beauty and the Butch.  Unfortunately, it's not a long story and won't take more than an hour to read at 50ish pages.  Even so, I'd of probably rated it 4 stars if the stupid drunken brother-in-law hadn't cut in on this story with the lame conflict.  The last bit of the story was... meh.

I'm not sure why this butch didn't show up packing to those lustful piano lessons at LEAST once... that no-harness dildo scene just didn't cut it, Paisley.  The butch shoulda been packing!!!!. lol.

Nikias, the older brother of Daryle's boyfriend, Alexis, is dead set against his little brother marrying a ""gold digger"", and also plans to put a stop to the wedding. While the young lovers hide under an alias, Diona checks into a hotel under her own name, and Nikias arranges for her to be ""invited"" to stay at his island home. Diona thinks the invitation is from her sister's boyfriend and accepts the invitation so she can talk them out of the marriage. When she arrives on the island, she's met by older brother Nikias who is convinced that Diona is the woman his brother plans to marry, and he informs her that he plans to keep her prisoner on the island until her flight home. Nikias is sure he has the right woman and no amount of arguing or reasoning on Diona's  part will convince him otherwise.Nikias is disturbed by how much he is drawn to his  brother's supposed girlfriend. He's rich, handsome and a bit of a playboy, but he's never been attracted to a woman like he is to her.  As he and Diona spend time together, he starts to wonder if maybe she's telling the truth, but he won't let himself doubt that he's right. As the mistaken identities get worked out, the broken trust remains an issue, both for Diona and Nikias and Nikias and his brother, Alexis. Until that can be mended and the breaches healed, those relationships have no chance.

2454,For a free kindle book I thought this story was a great deal. I laughed out loud many times and enjoyed the characters a lot. There were lots of great secondary characters that I can't wait to read their stories too. My only complaint is that it was too short!! Thank goodness there are a couple more to this series to read and hopefully more to come in the future.,very fun read

Don't get me wrong I understand that this was a prequel so to speak, but it didn't hold any ending. It didn't get me hooked on the characters.

And all this is taking place with her cousin, the Doctor, sleeping within a few feet of them along with her sister(Lucinda)who is comatose due to a beating and near rape by a wild patient.Not once does Gabrielle get up to check on her sister...just keeps playing the virgin wannabe slut with Simon. Such a depressing and disgusting scene,imo.As far as the rest of the book...well I didn't feel like there was that much depth to the H and h.

2460,"Talk about a collection - when i saw the size of this beast i wondered if I had seen a glitch, if my eyes were giving out after all the horror I had read, or if Kindle was giving me yet another taste of the good life. I had already collected Dracula and a few others for next to nothing, and this seemed like I was doing the same. So i clicked, checked, and was a happy camper.While you have a lot of small things here, the 67 alone is enough to send a reader into some mind-altered vortex that says, ""Danger, Will Robinson."" That danger was not danger at all, however, but was something that was good to the last drippy drop. you really can't beat the size of the beast you get here and, honestly, you can't keep from admiring just how lovely this thing is.

Nevertheless, the author writes quite well which made it more interesting to me; however, the constant interruptions that she included to keep the main couple apart got irritating! Also,if I had realized that she would include explicit gross sex scenes, I probably never would have chosen this book as I don't think her first book was so overly sexual.

This wasn't my favorite erotica I've ever read. I usually enjoy erotica but this one had just a little too much voyeurism, and the story line bounced all over the place. This was also supposed to be a romance, and it lived up to that much better. I enjoyed the play back and forth between Antonio and Sasha. All in all this book wasn't that great.

My problem is that I have no interest in her male/male books and think it should be clearly stated in the book description. It was not! Had the free sample to read been a page or two longer, it would have been clear when the men began kissing. Had the three previous book reviewers stated this, I would have known to avoid the book. I even went to the author's website (before buying the book) where her books are broken into themes, M/M being one of those, but this book was not listed as a M/M. If this is your thing, then by all means buy the book, but if you are opposed to M/M kissing and oral sex, avoid!

2469,"Ugh. Bad. Terrible. Embarrassing. Offensive.I could have stopped my review there, but there is so much shade to be thrown right now.Here is the entire summary of the incredibly thin plot: College athletes Maverick and Duke are in love but they will never admit it because THEY ARE NOT GAY.THEY ARE NOT GAY.NO GAY HERE.NOPE.WE ARE STRAIGHT.WE LIKE THE LADIES.But...if you want to, we can sleep in the same bed and cuddle. Or hold hands. Or make out. We love and care about each other BUT ONLY AS FRIENDS. So let's spend literally an entire novella playing Gay Chicken, because that makes so much sense.This story just made no sense. It was actually embarrassing to read because these two guys acted so disgusted by each other until they were literally having sex. Every other sentence was just denial, denial, denial. ENOUGH ALREADY. This is not a PSA, this is a fluffy erotica novella. We do not want to read some dumb college kid's diatribes about how he looooooves the ladies so he CAN'T POSSIBLY BE GAY.This short, short story was SO trope-heavy, too. So many tropes in one tiny novella. We had Gay for Pay, Gay for You, Only Gay If I Take It Up the Butt, Doing it On a Dare, Camp Gay, Skin the Color of Food Racism, Big Gay Panic, Homophobe Bully, Homophobic Until Proven Gay...The list goes on and on.This story was a waste. It wasn't sexy. It was poorly written, insensitive, offensive, and oftentimes sexist, racist, and homophobic. It is written in a juvenile way with no narrative drive, no creative devices, and very little background info or subplot for either characters.I have so few standards when it comes to romance novels.  SO FEW.  And this still managed to disappoint.Skip this and read something better. It isn't worth the money.","If You Want Believable Characters, Don't Read This"

2477,"It is either hit or miss with me for J.L. Langley and her/his books. But with ""His Convenient Husband,"" the author pulls off the time honored tradition in romance novels - a marriage of convenience - and does it with style. Because Micah and Tucker had a great backstory, the reader was rooting for them to get together from the beginning. Langley's secondary characters, even the 'bad guy,' felt natural to the plot line and gave the reader an overall explanation of why Tucker and Micah marry not for love but to keep their family's ranch. By the end of the book, you were hoping for more: more plot, more sex, more Tucker and Micah's love story...which is always a plus when reading a novella. This is a universe I could visit again. 4 stars for ""His Convenient Husband.""",A terrific read

2481,"I cried real splishy splashy tears, the mark of a good book. This was such a moving and thought provoking story to be aimed at a younger audience but I think older readers would enjoy it too. William Woodall really gets into the mind of a 14 year old boy. What I like about this author is that he's not trying to be like anyone else. He's not copycating C.S. Lewis like so many others try to do. He's not afraid to approach the Christian aspect but he doesn't beat anyone over the head with it either.  His work is unique and I really enjoy it.I think he should have included discussion questions at the end of this book because there are so many ways to start a conversation with the many themes it contains.I would give the writing 4 stars only because the characters weren't as distinct as in other books I have read by this author. For instance, the names Brandon and Brian were so similar I kept confusing them. I thought the two main characters could have used something in their speech to set each one apart. I really enjoyed the unique way he has of putting things though. Here's an example.""Nor did he dream, except the sweet and simple dreams of the pure at heart, of the kind that nourish the soul but are never remembered.""I should also mention that the writing reminded me of a bedtime story in places. Some people might find that a bit distracting but I felt it added to the fairy-tale fantasy feel. I give the story line 5 whole stars. I'm sure someone has written about similar things but this felt original to me.The Christian aspect I'd give 5 stars also. It is very appropriate for the intended YA audience but also appealing to a much wider age range. I could see reading this book in a homeschool setting. I guess because there are so many nuggets of truth hidden in there. It's about Heaven. It's about bad things happening for a reason. It's about deciding for yourself what matters most in life. It's a really good book!I am working on his short story collection next.Note: I wasn't asked to review this book and I bought my own copy. I'm a blogger and I have access to tons of free books.

2484,"I give this author full marks in engaging me in the story. I went from beginning to end wanting to know more and more about Jay, Anita and CAIN as well as what was going on in the story. However when I got to the end and it seemed the three very characters that made the book interesting, well, were less for the story, I was disappointed.It is an excellent first book to build on a universe, and launch the series though. Well written, and as I said engaging. It conveyed the excitement of testing the first FTL drive of humanity well. Then first contact with aliens was as exciting as one might imagine. Full of hope, then everything goes south. While overall in the end the universe is better for it, the three people I investing interest in the story were in worse shape at the end than the beginning.I was unsurprised by the way the author went with the AI at the end, its the trend it seems. Technically Anita may have been better off, but this is not a feel good ending kind of story. Save for the state of the universe.The author writes well, and probably has some good stories coming up with the set up this book has been, but I don't think I'll be giving him another read through.Good points, the writing, the world building, the characters and even the battles are very well handled.The bad points, the ending. Normally I say that if I've really loved and book and didn't want it to end, this time its I arrived at the last page disappointed.It is not a feel good kind of ending, it is a good ending though.

What I cannot forgive, however, is the misuse of words in a book!!!  Writers need to do more than use spellcheck to find those--they need to actually READ THE BOOK.  They started showing up @ 75%, so for some reason the writer got in a hurry to finish this book. Perhaps they were sick of it too.unforgivable are:peace when it should be pieceshuttered when it should be shudderedsaver when it should be savorknow when it should be nowsummons when it should be summon...And I did not set out to look for errors, these just jumped off the page they were so bad...it disrupts the entire thought process when you run across stupid errors like these.I'm glad I did not pay for this book, as it wasn't worth any money. I will not read anything from this ""author"" again.In this day and age everyone seems to think they can write a book, but it is not that easy to write a GOOD book. I suggest this writer read some very good books to figure out why this stuff is just ""tripe"".  The author needs to take English 101.

She was told to be gone when he got out of the shower and to leave no trace of her behind. How is that her leaving him and causing him to be the bitter one when he was mean like that? He did not try to figure out why she was doing that and never having a serious conversation with her once in their time together would also make her a bit defensive with not knowing why his attitude had changed. He loved her and wanted her but never really showed it and she loved him but was scared about her past messing up his reputation.

Doan is a throw back to Ellery Queen and Sherlock, but much more self-effacing with a good hint of humor throughout.  he is noteworthy for having virtually no gifts of physical prowess or mental facilities, but wins the day anyway.The plot is fun and this is a good story to introduce Doan (not so much Carstairs).

2498,"Beautiful Demons is the second book by Sarra Cannon I have read. I didn't love the first one, The Trouble With Goodbye, but I realized I already had this book, and in some reviews for TTWG the reviewers stated they liked this series much better, so I thought I would give it a try. While I did like it better than the first book, it still wasn't amazing. I will, however, read the second book once I get through some of my library books.Beautiful Demons starts off with Harper being sent to another foster home. This is her last chance. She knows there is something different about her, but she tries to keep that secret for good reason. She accidentally started a fire when she was younger, when she gets mad things move by themselves, just things she doesn't know how to deal with. Shadowford Home is a strange place, but she is determined to make it work.Her first day of school she sees them - the cheerleaders. She had run into the star quarterback when school shopping, but once Drake found out where she lived he couldn't get away fast enough. The whole school has an obsession with the cheerleaders. They all want to be them. They are the most beautiful people in school, and date the cutest guys. Harper makes enemies pretty quick with the queen bee, but tries to stay out of trouble. She doesn't understand all the hype with them. Sure they are pretty, but so what? She also has some strange things happen to her in her first few weeks. She faints when she walks by the demon statue on her first day! She has strange dreams and people act odd. She knows something is up with the town.Harper does become friends with one of the girls she lives with, and has a huge crush on the guy who lives behind their house (the one caretakers son), Jackson. There is the instant connection with Harper and Jackson and he is trying to keep her safe. She wants to know what is going on in the town, but Jackson cannot tell her. He does his best though.Now up until this point in the book I was really enjoying it. Then one night Harper has a weird dream, is sick for a week, and when she wakes up she cannot remember what has recently happened. She can only remember a little bit of her time at Shadowford Home. The cheerleaders starts being nice to her and trying to be her friends, and Drake starts talking to her like he wants to date her. Harper, after only like 2 minutes of what is going on, is suddenly drawn into their crowd. I didn't get it. Well I got why she was, but it didn't actually seem like she was different. The writing didn't make her seem like she would suddenly want to be a cheerleader, when before she was scoffing at them. I wish it would have been more like she changed, or something made her change, to make her just forgive Drake and be all yes! This is what I want. I just didn't see it. You could still keep the moments where she thinks something is not quite right, but I didn't see her actually changing enough, or being lonely enough and wanting to fit in any way possible, for her to be trying out for the cheerleaders.Then you don't really find out what is going on in the town at all in this book. It is a pretty short book, and you don't really learn much. Hopefully some of the secrets will be revealed in the next book. It wasn't horrible, but the second half was kind of a let down. I just wish it would have been more obvious that Harper changed, instead of having her be basically the same but not. We shall see how the next book is.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","Interesting idea, but you don't learn much in this story"

The author doesn't develop her ideas well, and randomly starts using French. The middle made me like the main characters, and the ending was abrupt! She so couldve developed that better.

The conversation between Rick and Carolyn does seem too confusing at times.  Its like the author wrote this without realizing others besides herself would be reading it. (We're supposed to understand what's going on, even though she hasn't told us). While I can basically understand where she is going, I am often times lost in the dialogue.  I will finish reading because as I said I like where she is going with it.  The ebonics aren't bad, when you really look at how the rappers speak, it seems genuine.  For those who did not understand it, I feel for you.  With the dialogue as it is and then to throw in ebonics, I'm sure you are more confused then I am. I read books for concept.  The book is keeping me reading because of it.  I am wondering where she is going with this?? It's off to a decent, rather long start. On the concept, I give five stars, on the execution i can only give two stars, therefore I will settle for three stars.",Still Wondering

2505,First off I'd like to mention to those that complain they were not forwarned about the fact that this was not a full length novel-must not have read the very beginning when the author clearly states that it is a novella-not a full length novel.I admire Pinter's writing style and his depth of characterization and plots. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because this type of genre is not my cup of tea.,Talented writer
2506,"I like the idea-- man in drag, some straight guy, then he realizes he's actually gay or converts someone else. Actually, I will read anything with this concept. The plot was faintly ridiculous however. Maybe it was always going to be, but waiting for the cops to bust a house-wife organized pot ring was a bit much. But hey, I read romance so I would have let it go if the characters were good enough.But, I actually found it faintly unpleasant that our hero knew so little about the guy he was shacking up with. The love interest was so subdued that I wasn't sure what he felt. The author attempted to fix this at the end by having the character say something like, 'you didn't say much but your actions spoke for you.' Oh brother.Sex scenes were not bad, but it was no Grey's Awakening, lemme tell you.",Not great and not awful

2508,"I started out liking this book--the disfigured Magnus and the not so beautiful Agatha seemed to be good characters.  However, it was too much of the same old same old with their thoughts not being said, and them misunderstanding each other because of lack of communication.The whole killing scene was absolutely ridiculous--and I definitely figured out who was after Agatha way before anything happened.What was the point of the friend from America, Katherine?  She didn't add anything to the plot at all.  She was just extra conversation with Magnus' friend, George.Don't waste your time reading this.",Just not enough of a plot here.

I found myself looking forward to re-joining Jim as he drove around in his big-rig looking for his brother.  The story line with Pete was exciting and I found I read faster & faster as the excitement built.

2515,"This is a short story first published in 1940 as a two part serial in the pulp fiction magazine Argosy. The author later decided to develop the characters in three novellas which have also been adapted to the Kindle. This is a very quick read, and thus since it is so inexpensive I recommend that anyone who is interested in the genre and plans to read the subsequently published books( which I rate highly) should read it first.The main character in this book is the detective Doan, and unfortunately his huge Great Dane Carstairs makes only a cameo introductory appearance.  Fortunately, in the subsequent stories Carstairs plays an integral role and adds immeasurably to the reader's enjoyment. Doan's unimpressive appearance leads his adversaries to underestimate his (and Carstairs') skill and intelligence, and in this introduction to his character the author has not yet fully developed Doan's skills. However, it is still a typical pulp fiction story concerning a hard boiled detective except for the fact that as the author developed the characters over the series he injected much more humor than was usual for that era.After an interesting introduction to the series' characters in the first few chapters, Doan is tasked to protect a young heiress about to receive her inheritance. He travels to a wilderness resort cabin, and becomes isolated there with a strange cast of characters while a blizzard rages outside. However,  murders occur, misdirection abounds, and of course he eventually untangles the web of deceit, earning his keep and rescuing a damsel in distress.. As in all short stories of this type, the prose is spare and the character development minimal. But a fast pace keeps the reader's interest.Unfortunately,  the author Norbert Davis is not as well known as other pulp fiction writers of the period for three reasons. First, his stories encompassed a wide array of genres, so he never built a reputation as a practitioner  of specific type (e.g. detective, SF, etc.) . Second, his detective stories included a strain of humor which was highly unusual for the period, a hard boiled detective story was not supposed to be funny. Third, he committed suicide at age 40, supposedly after he had been diagnosed with cancer. Thus, his potential literary legacy was truncated. However, among his peers he was regarded as in a class with the best writers of the era, including Hammett and McDonald. He graduated from Stanford with a law degree, but never took the bar exam - choosing instead to pursue a career which he had already established by being published while still in college, usually being paid at the going rate of a penny a word. Hopefully, the advent of ebooks and specialized small presses will allow many more potential fans to enjoy his works and be delighted by Carstairs' collaborations with Doan.Also, after reading this short story you can decide if you agree with me that the author's choice of title was very clever due to the multiple images invoked.Tucker Andersen 6/4/2010",Recommended as Intro to the Series - Wonderful Character Sketches
2516,"I was disappointed in this story, it was too short and lacked the substance that I have experienced in other works by this author.

2520,"I was frustrated with this book. I really love Dohner's New Species series, but I'll have to say that I'm not going to be reading anymore about Zorn Warriors.I can respect Dohner's ability to create dynamic cultures in her books. I read Ral's Woman and decided to give Kidnapping Casey a try, but I honestly wish I didn't. I don't like the culture of Zorn (I can respect Dohner's ability to create it, but it doesn't mean that I necessarily like it). I get that its an Alpha Male borderline D/s world, but the way that Argernon and Casey's relationship played out just wasn't cool for me.I'll have to agree with other reviewers here that rape = rape, yes, even if your rapist brings you to orgasm. I thought it was sweet that Argernon cared about Casey so much. I get that she's a gamechanger for him. I don't like that he tied her up (twice) and after she repeatedly says no (twice), they still end up doing the deed and Casey's all right with it. Oh, and he ties her up afterwards, because he doesn't trust her. And keeps her tied up for days, even making her wear a chastity belt so she can't please herself, and parades around in front of her trying to make her want him. Seems like the Zorn guys are no better than their pointy-eared counterparts, the Collis. I did not like Argernon, because he never learns that it is not ok to kidnap and rape someone. Its not ok to replace 3 girls last minute and expect your new girl to accept you. And Casey just seemed like a silent victim. I felt sorry for her. Somebody said that she was strong and could hold her own... silent strength and holding on to her pain? Yea.I felt like maybe I would've liked this book better if it was drawn out a bit more. Like, I would've liked to see Casey go to Berrr and get unbounded. Then she could've dated and get Argernon to win her love. But whatever. This book is what it is. This is the end of the Zorn for me. I will continue to read about Dohner's New Species and Cyborgs, but I'm not interested in Rever or Berrr.",Not liking this much...

2525,"When I read the description for this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Once I downloaded it to my Kindle, I found it extremely hard to keep reading it.  To be honest, I stopped reading halfway through the book. It began slow and remained a slow, uninteresting read.  It lacked passion; not making love passion, but passion for life. Neither Jada or Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too `everything is perfect'.  Everybody is just so understanding and accommodating--the bit of drama with his father and her grandmother was blah.  To give an example of what I mean (and there are MANY), Aaron finally finds out almost  half way into the book that he fathered a child 5 years ago--keep in mind that Aaron and Jada kept in contact for a few months after he left and she never mentioned to him that she was pregnant. When she finally tells him he has a son, Aaron becomes overwhelmed with emotions (misty eyed) knowing that he's a father. WTH!  I think most men would be upset/angry to know that they had a child and the woman they love never told them! Not in this book; it's all good--all is well; NO PASSION.  OMG, don't let me get started on the scene when father and son finally meet. It was so over the top, it made me want to barf. Maybe if this scene had been towards the beginning of the book, it would have been touching. In the middle of the book after just too much blah it made me thrown down my kindle.  It was like eating a sweet dessert that was so sweet it made your teeth hurt. This book had a good theme, but no follow-through. Also, if we're to believe that Jada graduated from Harvard, then let it be reflected in her speech and her job. We're told that she has this wonderful personality which caused Aaron to fall in love with her--never saw it. If the author had described her as depressed and foolish--Yes! I would believe it in a heartbeat. She was boring. This book was so frustrating to read.  I truly struggled to read it as far as I did.  I finally stopped torturing myself because I realized it wasn't going to get any better.",Boring! Boring! Boring!
2526,This is a good book but badly written. There are many flashbacks in the book that have no warning or intro. There are no separations that would be found in better written books. I would be reading and suddenly nothing made sense! The author also does a horrible job of introducing characters. She mentions a character's name but doesn't tell who they are or want they are relevant to the story until later in the book. It to me forever to figure out who Beatrice was! I wanted to enjoy this book but it's bad writting and syntax made it hard to read.,Confusing read
2527,"In a nutshell:I'm going to purchase the next book and see where it leads.I feel like the primary character needed to have a bit more age and experience... and perhaps a little more inertia to his intellect rather than just constantly winging it and winning against a clever antagonist.Felt kinda like ""I grew up in the outback, now I'm kicking butt""Maybe something bridging or providing background... (another novel?) that would kinda put some meat on the character?I guess I'm saying the character's 'awesomeness' was explained in a rather uninspiring fashion.The setting is fairly well done.  The background characters are likable, even the bad guys.  Characters behave in a way that is quite reasonable to their personality and interests (ie, bad guys *not* making stupid mistakes by supposed overconfidence, the crutch of bad storytelling).",pretty good read
2528,"The story was good.Where the story is concerned, this book had it going on. The characters were interesting and the action was consistent, and the dialog was stimulating.The writing could have used a bit of work.It was clear that the writer didn't re-read her story prior to publishing, or these simple grammar errors would not have happened. I found myself chuckling every time I came across one, because it usually involved a missing word, or a word used out of context, and it was somewhat amusing. But this book was rick with these kinds of errors.But if I were to base my review on the substance and not the details, I would say that this book was very good, although it could have been longer.Stories with endings will create more fans than stories that leave you hanging. Especially with 24 books in The Hunter lineup.

2531,"After years of suppressing memory, Dinah Westlake's thoughts begin to unfold, revealing long hidden secrets concerning her pregnant cousin, Annabel's murder.Marcus Denlin has returned to Charleston with his thirteen year old son, amidst not carefully hidden accusations that he was responsible for his wife's death. This was the first time that Marc had allowed any relationship with his son's mother's kin. Neither Dinah, nor Aunt Kate, could enter the house. Dinah had fought against the terrors of that night.Marc looked successful. He was a corporate attorney, and he was selling the houseBitterness tinged his voice. Vulnerability showed in normally guarded eyes. Court was a normal, bright, happy boy. He probed for information about his mother. He became obsessed. He needed to know, and asked to have a Charleston Christmas. There are interesting plots, intriguing twists, contradictory intentions, and finger pointing suspense in this novel. Mystery, romance, action, emotional tangles, and dramatic situations are tied together neatly, expertly, as they wait for readers to untie the woven Gordian Knot. It all had to come out. The truth had to be said even if the rest of the world never knew. The killer was a fallible human.

2536,"I was able to get this book several years ago free for my Kindle and I'm just now getting to it in my ""to be read"" list.  I'm not quite sure why, but it doesn't recognize that I got it on Amazon anymore as it usually does at the top of the product page.  I wish this book had been longer.  The only real problem I had with it is that, even being short, I would have preferred that it have chapter demarcations.  That would make it so much easier to find a stopping place or see how close to the end of a chapter you are when you need/want to do so.  That's not so much of a big problem when the book is short or you're reading a novella, but it's still nice.  I really felt for the characters in this book and they seem mostly real to me, but there was a bit of irrationality mixed in that I don't think would have completely been that way in real life.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you like light adventure stories with a smattering of intrigue and suspense, I think you'll enjoy this story, especially if you like a tad of sexual tension and titillation.  Have at it!  I can't wait to read the next one.",Cute adventure story
2537,"This was a well told, interesting Kindle short. It reminded me of an odd dream where everything seems real but nothing is really as it should be. There is no good way to explain the story without giving too much away (although there really is no beginning, middle, or ending, it just 'is'. )It is easy to read into where the tale is going but then, it doesn't. But that is what makes it good. It is not contrived or common.A quick and quirky tale that left me wanting to read more of Mr. Hill's work.",Like an Odd Dream with a little Horror

The days follow and Drew notices a little change in her.  Sidney admits to wanting more with Brody, she feels there was unfinished business.  Drew starts to doubt his decision of the threesome but decides to have one more time together.Drew loves Sidney but unsure of her feelings because she has never returned those words.  Sidney has spent her whole life moving from one town to the next, she is unsure how to settle down & be a wife.  Brody is a drifter but is also Drew's best friend and thinks he has feelings for Sidney which is tearing him apart.  The author has you loving each of these characters, you want them all to get the happy ending they each want.  The last time all three are together I was on the edge of my seat reading what will happen at the end.  The reader gets to read the view point from all three characters.  And of course there was a twist at the end that gave the book the perfect ending.

2555,"I would like to think that I am capable of suspending my skepticism and enjoy a good escapist romance, and that was how I felt the majority of this book. Unfortunately by the end things just got way too out of hand for me to continuing making excuses for the story. The story was somewhat cute but the title should have been a major indication of the style of writing. If the author seriously couldn't come up with anything more creative for a title other than Touchdowns and Potions, you really can't have the highest expectations for the writing and plot line (my mistake), because that was literally what the story was, a football player and a girl with a love potion.This could have been a interesting story and I do commend the author for avoiding a lot of cliches but there was little to no character development and within a span of a few pages (spoiler alert) everything is perfect, then Andy is a liar, Jenna conveniently has a voicemail for a job in Texas, airline ticket provide and all (IN A MESSAGE BEFORE THEY EVER SPOKE WITH HER) so she's off to the airport, and then Andy's slimy football teammate is trying to rape Jenna in the middle of no where. If you're reading this a pulling a double take, yeah that just happened.For the price it's not bad and if you can suspend your disbelief, go for it, but the writing was mediocre and repetitive and characters were incredibly one demensional. The only semi-redeeming element was Jenna's relationship with the ""meddling older woman"" but even that is pretty ridiculous.

I can see that.&#8221; But it&#8217;d been years since my early OMG-I-LOVE-Ilona binge, so I decided a reread was in order.And here we are.Some time in the indeterminate future, when space colonization was the new Big Thing, humans began to genetically enhance themselves. They needed to be stronger, faster, heartier, more versatile. Some of these enhancements were tech-based, effecting only the individual, and some were biological, being inherited by offspring.&#34;It was quickly realized that the advantage of these biological enhancements lay in their exclusivity. Thus, the biologically enhanced united and shut down all further biological modification.&#34;And consolidated their power. They were called the Kinsmen, and to maintain both the potency and exclusivity of their enhanced blood, the families arranged marriages for their children based on bloodlines and business alliances.This is why Meli Galdes was betrothed to Celino Carvanna when she was 10 years old and he was 16.While neither of them was happy with the arrangement, Meli accepted it, but Celino did NOT. He worked the next 6 years to make himself indispensable to his family, and worth more as an individual than the alliance with the Galdes family.And he succeeded.But where did that leave Meli?An excellent question. And one you will only get the answer to by . . . wait for it . . . yes, that&#8217;s right&#8212;READING the book. *winsome face*Verdict: a quick, fun, and SEXY read.

2559,"Bought this book because I have had a good experience with NJ Walters before. Normally I see the Ellora's Cave ribbon at the top and move on.This books was cute but not memorable. Started it on one device and finished it on another- only to return and re-read about 60% again before I finally realized that I had actually already finished it. That will teach me to turn off the Kindle sync feature.I didn't find the characters unbelievable or unrelatable as the one-star reviewer did. I enjoy characters who are older than 25 and have minimal sexual experience- not every woman out there sleeps with every date or boyfriend or has a wild period in their early 20's. I like a male lead who realizes that he is ready to settle and he sees something in woman who isnt on the prowl or overtly sexual. Annabelle was worthwhile to him and he was prepared to work to gain her trust and to see herself the way he did.Components of a book are present: beginning, middle, end, conflict and climax, a good editor, and an author who understand how to tell a story. Its not a deep read, or a clean read, or a long read, but it was enjoyable.",Cute but not memorable
2560,Great read.  This one would be a great one to have in every school so children would grow up knowing what black people were struggling with in the 1800's.,Plantation days in the South

2565,I love how this author can totally make you hate someone! She keeps it juicy and the ending is superb.,Titillating
2566,"An interesting book. I found it too short though. The ending also went too quick. 1 minute she had time, then she was dead, brought back and taken away because she was Fae. A lot of explanation needed to be added to better understand how things were supposed to work. Still all in all a good story.",Too Short
2567,"I really enjoyed this book. It had a lot of steamy almosts, and a lot of steamy &#34;oh yeahs&#34;, I enjoyed getting to know the characters and some of their background. There were a few things in the side stories that left me wondering about though, as if they were forgotten about due to the main story. I wanted to know what happened between Cassie and Kari, did they talk it out, or just part ways, were there words between the two, it is like the storyline of that part just got dropped.I also wanted to know more about Sarah's story. The other part was talking about the portrait in the antique shop, what happened with the back story to that one, who sold the portrait and why, will we find out all these things later in one of the other books? I know it sounds as if I am complaining, I am not, just left wondering, what if? In other parts of the story I am befuddled, but don't want to go into details because I don't want to give some of the story's secrets away.The story is really well written with lots of details and I definitely plan on reading the rest of the series, because I am hooked on the characters. I just wished there were more werewolf scenes, although I do realize this story was more about Cassie, I guess I wanted a little more action. Overall it is a really good book and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. The author definitely keeps me wanting more!",Good read!
2568,"This story has a good balance of paranormal without totally abandoning reality.  I like Jackson's different spin on some traditional paranormal themes.I enjoyed this story enough that I am willing to overlook the editing errors in the book.

While I didn't like the beginning because of the turmoil that was going on with Zsadist and his unacceptance of his daughter.I sped through the book because I needed to know that he overcame his obstacles and as usual the book did not disappoint.I was happy for Zsadist when he finally worked through his issues and was delighted to see the family dynamic between him, his wife and his daughter.Great read.  I would love to read about Rhage and Mary as the author hinted in this book that Mary wanted to have a child.  Also, and update on the King and Queen would be nice.",Wonderful look into Zsadist and Bella

I downloaded it and was intrigued by the concept of why the authors wrote it. It was a fast paced story that left me going ""Ugh, gross, no way..omg""... all the way through it. I am pleased to say I am now a fan of the authors, their ability to yank you into the perspective of their killers is amazing. It was a fast paced read that left me entertained in a very disturbing manner, but entertaining none the less. I recommend this to any who enjoy a nice bit of horror to pass the day.",Very Graphic
2573,"Search ""erotic stories"" on the Kindle and you will get literally hundreds of results, covering every preference, sub-genre, and price point.  After seeing all that, I had to buy at least one erotic title (okay, I bought a second one a few days later).  Anyway, this is the first of the two books I bought.  It's not a bad deal.  For less than a buck, you get a friendly guy cavorting with three enthusiastic women in some English country house somewhere, with everyone doing everything to everyone else over the course of several days.  For an old book from the British/""By Anonymous"" erotic sub-genre, the prose is bouncy, fast-moving, and the outlook generally upbeat (no mean-spiritness, or bad judgements toward the women for enjoying the sex).  The book is of a decent length, and laid out (no pun intended) nicely for the Kindle, as if someone actually spent time to cleanly convert the text to the digital medium.  Things do get a little repetitive, as the happy male in the story seems to like the same three or four activities over and over, but, heck, I wasn't expecting Tolstoy when I bought this.  If you're open to this sort of thing, I'd say give ""A Weekend Visit"" a try.",I've certainly had worse weekends than the guy in this book

Ron Hubbard's first science fiction story. Purportedly, the editor was looking for something that was breezy, funny and easy-to-read. I have no idea if this really true, but this short story is certainly all of those things.Sadly, it's just not a very good short story.Dr. Henry Mudge has worked out the mathematics of how to transport oneself instantly from one place to another just by imagining that place. He calls this formula Equation C.But, controlling your mind enough to use this technique is difficult. Try not to think of a place when you hear someone talk about it. So, when someone says a place to Dr. Mudge he goes there, including the moon and Mars. Meanwhile, he is supposed to be giving a major presentation at his university to a group of professors if he can just get there and stay there without bouncing off somewhere else...While a cute concept, the story just does not work all that well if you think it through. The internal consistency is just not there. Also, despite the fact that the cover has an exploding space ship on it, there are no space ships in this short story.The story is accompanied by an uncritical, enthusiastic biography of Hubbard that mostly skips over the Scientology stuff.","While a cute concept, the story just does not work all that well."

2577,"It was free, or I never would have even considered this book, just by the title and the little I knew about it.  I should have gone with my gut - if I wouldn't pay money for it, then why waste my time reading it?!?  There was barely a plot and it amazed me how ""into it"" she was. I mean, this guy was her new boss.  MAYBE I can let some of this slide and go along with that she was madly in love/lust with this guy and so she was up for anything with him.  But his friend, Wade??? Give me a break! Just the description of the guy made me want to gag, much less the things she did with him.This is truly a case of ""you get what you pay for"" and in my case I paid nothing.  For those of you who do actually spend money on this trash - know that it takes less than an hour to read it, so even if you do end up enjoying the book, think about how much you are willing to spend for an hours worth of ""entertainment"".",Embarrassed to Admit I Read This

It may be free but don&#8217;t waste your time as you&#8217;ll never get that back I sure wont. To make it worse the female lead was a split personality that went from a battered, scared introverted woman who was petrified of her husband to an independent, confident woman who could take on the world from the smile of a complete stranger she immediately fell in love with.

2584,"Elizabeth MacMillan leads a charmed life. She has a good husband who provides well for her and their son Christopher. They live in an upper/middle class subdivision with good neighbors and friends where nothing bad ever happens. That is, right up until the moment when Brad decides he needs some more space and moves out. Now, twelve months later, Brad has disappeared and Elizabeth finds herself in the unenviable position of not only having to provide for herself and Christopher, but also having to face all those people she once thought were good neighbors and friends.Max Marino has finally reached the place in his life where things are looking up; he has built up his own construction company and has a good contract going. Or so he thinks, right up until the moment a crazy lady comes flying past his worksite and almost runs over one of his men. Angry as all get out and not thinking too clearly, Max jumps in his truck and follows the crazy lady home. He bursts into her kitchen only to find the lady sitting at her table in tears, after giving her a good talking down he leaves her house feeling like a louse.Max and Elizabeth both think of their disastrous meeting as just something that happens, and put it out of their minds until they once again meet up at the hospital where Elizabeth is seeking employment. This time the meeting is more subdued and both realize that they just might find something about the other that they like. Feeling contrite about their first meeting, Max offers to help her fix her gutters and when a hesitant Elizabeth turns him down, he gives her his card just in case she changes her mind. Elizabeth has more on her mind then good looking men though. Christopher is not dealing well with his father's abandonment, she has to struggle to make ends meet and all their friends have now turned into petty, spiteful people. Luckily for Elizabeth, the other fallen woman of the neighborhood, Leslie Gibson, comes calling and offers friendship and a shoulder to cry on.Can life go on for this little rag tag group of misfits, or will they not be able to get over their own individual heartaches? Seasons will change and only time will tell.Ms. Forster is the master of storytelling. She writes in different genres, from legal thrillers and spine tingling mysteries, to women's romance, all of which have one thing in common, her ability to tell a good story filled with rich characters and thought provoking plots.In this story she tells us of one woman's struggle to become an independent person while continuing to be the mother she desires to be, and hopefully finding peace with a man who truly cares about her. Elizabeth is not a strong woman when we first meet her, as a matter of fact she is everything I personally don't like in a woman. She is totally bound to her husband and when he leaves her she can't cope. She doesn't know how to make a living, isn't sure how to handle her son, hasn't ever had a close friend and can't figure out how to deal with a good man. I have to say I didn't like her in the beginning, and even though she grew throughout the story, I still found her a bit of a selfish one dimensional person.Max, on the other hand, was a good man through and through. He took on Elizabeth, Christopher and his own problems all with the patience and love of a saint. I gave him more than a little bit of my heart.Christopher was a troubled child who needed a much firmer hand than Elizabeth was capable of giving him, and my heart ached for him, though at times I just wanted to give him a good spanking.Leslie was a good friend and I would have liked to have gotten to know her better, I think she and I would have been friends.While I enjoyed this book, it wasn't my favorite of Ms. Forster's works. I just couldn't warm up to Elizabeth and that kept me from giving her any sympathy and took away from the book for me.I recommend anyone who enjoys a good chick lit to draw a hot bubble bath, grab a glass of their favorite beverage and settle in, they won't be disappointed.Member of the Paranormal Romance Guild Dual Review Team",A story of overcoming life's difficulties
2585,"I am not sure where to start... The story has so much promise but it was ruined by being way too long,  and then throwing in some religous lessons along the way. There is too much going on in this book, it screams for a good editor. The plot is very technical, I am not sure that someone without a degree in Science (I do) could follow it. It needs to be (and can easily be) simplified for the layman. The ending was a dissapointment. I would not recommend this book in it's current form, but it could be fixed and re-issued.",Just no...

She is subject to frequent spankings, embarrassing physical examinations, daily enemas, and being put on display. She is taught to obey and submit to whatever her new papa might do to her.I read the reviews and the description of this book and was looking forward to reading it. It did not live up to my expectations. There is a lot of spanking that happens and that is alright. I have never really cared for it and don't quiet understand the obsession that some people have with it but to each their own. I liked the part about enemas being administered but the book didn't really talk about it. It pretty much just told you that they had them and that is it.To tell the truth I found the book to be a bit boring. I did not find the parts that were supposed to be erotic exciting at all. I like more action in my erotic books, something to actually happen to them and for them to enjoy it. Throughout the whole book Clara only has one orgasm and that was done by a whole lot of touching. She has enemas, plugs put in her, spanked, put on display, rarely touch in a sensual way and often she didn't find much enjoyment in these things. I am fine with almost anything being done to a person as long as they are actually getting real pleasure out of it.One of the other reviews was right. This book read a lot like those old Victorian erotica. If you have read Slaves of the Hypnotist by Bill Adler or First Training by James Jennings then this book reads a lot like those. If you liked the books I mentioned then you probably will like this one too but I didn't care for it.",Disappointed

Blending history with fiction, her writing is full of plot and adventure and her characters are strong and believable. Most of all, I grew to love all of them and cared about their hardships and successes.Aislinn is quite the main protagonist. She's tenacious and bold, beautiful and strong. The romance that blooms between her and the prince is well developed after years of solid friendship and teasing.

Hunter propositions her because he had been disfigured due to an accident and doesn't think he can get female companionship without making them some type of deal.  Lila thinks she hates him because in order to save her father's business she has to bend to his will.  She's ashamed of her circumstances but can't deny she enjoys the things that he does to her body.  Hunter is always in control when it comes to there love making.  It's however and whenever he says.

2607,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- There's a lot at the beginning of the story that I found intriguing: the avoidance early on of any direct references to ""werewolves"" or ""mates,"" Nate's reactions toward various people touching him, and his muteness (see cons also). The little hints here and there pertaining to Nate's background and what he's running from are revealed slowly in a way that really piqued my curiosity.- Joe, typical werewolf that he is, is incredibly protective and possessive of Nate, and these are traits I respond to every time I read about them, especially if the recipient of the protectiveness has never been cherished before. I really liked the scene in which Joe takes the time and effort to educate Nate extensively on what werewolf mating entails. Nate has a decent idea of what he's getting himself into before Joe claims him, even if Joe does conveniently forget a few things.- There's a good deal of sex in the story (it's light on plot, but it makes up for that with sex scenes), and for once there's a story element that allowed me to believe that one character could really climax twice within the span of 5 minutes EVERY time.CONS:- The language throughout is simplistic. (There's one page that contains the word ""quickly"" in 5 different sentences: quickly pulled, quickly lifted, quickly had them undone, quickly humped, quickly licked his finger...and there are 2 ""slowly""s in there, too.) In addition, the writing contains mistakes that make it seem pretty amateurish at times: isolated POV switches within scenes; needless repetition; a lot of focus on mundane descriptions; too many ""he""s without identifying which character they refer to (""He caught up with him just as he reached his motorbike""); etc.- A lot of the transitions in the book seemed rushed and/or poorly developed to me. The revelation of the men's desire for each other, for example, occurs suddenly with almost no buildup in preceding scenes. And Nate's transition from silent to chatty is the same way. He's entirely mute for the first several chapters, and then when he does first speak, it's not like he starts with one- and two-word answers and then gradually works his way up. He just launches into full-blown conversation mode.- Nate is basically just a stereotypical romance heroine with male anatomy. He's timid and tiny (as in, Joe and Nate are eye-to-eye when Joe is kneeling) and is expected to stay home and cook and clean like the proverbial Little Woman. The author does include a few little indications that such treatment bothers Nate (""it still rankled a bit""), but the two men's roles within the relationship seemed extreme to me.Overall comments: I didn't find this story quite as melodramatic as other Stormy Glenn stories I've read (although this one does contain its fair share of epic misunderstandings--at one point, Joe does something that hurts Nate's feelings and Nate thinks of 10 possible reasons for Joe's reaction but never even considers the most obvious one). My main complaint with the book is that the writing is far from the best I've read: it's plagued by sloppy phrasing and poor (if any) editing throughout. Writing issues aside, though, this is still a fun, frothy little story.","Feel-good story, but not the best writing"
2608,"I read this book in one night.  It was hot sex, threesomes and drama.  I loved the storyline and would defiantly read it again.  The ending is the best and actually had me on the edge a little.  i would defiantly read again and recommend to anyone",great book
2609,"I've been indulging in quite a few indie books lately.  Sometimes there's a gem.  Sadly, this is not one of them.The premise of Daughter of Deception is promising, and I was looking forward to discovering the different types of demons as Duke and Viola hunted.  I was unable to finish the book for a few reasons.1.  Like so many indie books, the lack of effective editing made it nearly unreadable.  I'm not saying responsibility doesn't lie with the author, but when you have an untried writer, a good editor makes all the difference.  Thorpe had many errors in tense, which became worse further into the book.  A sentence that made it past the copy editor: ""Viola shifted her grip on the knife's hilt, fights fought a wave of nausea..."" makes it obvious the author struggled with tense.2.  Her characters were inconsistent, so it was difficult to pick out motivations.  Viola expends a great deal of effort to get back in the Network, then quits after her first job?  She starts out self-assured and sharp, but quickly becomes something of a mess.  I wondered where the interesting heroine portrayed in the sample went.3.  Brief, unwarranted shifts in point of view were disorienting.  It really doesn't matter that much what Olivia thinks when on the phone with Viola.  Just stick with Viola.  Omniscience almost never works.Thorpe absolutely shows promise.  She has imagination that will serve her well down the road.  In the meantime, she needs to spend a whole heck of a lot of time in critique groups, getting her house in order before she publishes again.",Another one for the editor
2610,"This book had no depth.  The characters were superficial and the story was superficial.  We are expected to believe that the city's most eligible bachelor is madly in love with a girl he knew in high school and has spent years looking for her.

Second, she is supposed to be homely and inexperienced, yet seems to be quite at ease with this perfectly gorgeous, wealthy, and successful hunk.  It just didn't add up for me.",No depth

2612,"I never like leaving a bad review because I know this book is the creation of someone who worked very hard to write it.  However, it really lacked anything truly new.  I guess the concept of how a werewolf is ""activated"" is a bit novel, but the plot and simplicity of the story prevented me from giving it a higher rating.

2620,I bought this book because of all the five star reviews.  I think they may have come from the author's family and friends.  This book was just so-so at best.  The first half of the book was actually boring with little action.  Most of the book consisted of the main character wondering if what he was thinking and experiencing was real or was it due to his paranoid schizophrenia that had surfaced after 22 years under control.  Was someone really trying to drive him insane or was that just his paranoia?  There were some good points in the plot but not enough to make a good book.  Fortunately it was a quick read and the Kindle formatting was generally good.,Not all its cracked up to be
2621,Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com.,Good but a little too fast

2623,"GoodConcepts are interesting with a sorcerer society, changlings and created beings.The interplay of the Covenant versus the societyThe way that the sorcerer society maintained control through limiting knowledge.BadNot enough time spent on developing the concepts.Even after all the training you still don't have a good idea of what the Shadu really are, partly because all that information is imparted to the main character off screen. It leaves them feeling empty.Unfortunately this is kind of the problem with the whole book many of these great concepts just never get fully developed they leave the reader feeling underwhelmed about the whole setting.Characters are just brutalized everyone gets raped, tortured and abused now I don't mind it a little but when that seems to be the formula that applies to everyone it just loses the impact of the events and instead of adding to the story if just makes you move away from it. I am sure in the next book Yar-Soga will get raped and tortured if the author follows true to form.Characters that have great potential like Yenaga the teacher for the Shadu had great potential but then is just killed as soon as she becomes more than a wooden cutout.Killing off all the characters. Every few pages a character is killed off no one makes it out alive this gets repetitive after a while and stops you from ever really getting attached because you know they all die.Ending ThoughtsI really liked the book to start I thought it had great potential but the lack of detail on the world makes it hard to get immersed in it. Then you have the constant use of world changing events when you have a character raped it should be dramatic a major part of the plot not just something to do to make the world seem ""dark"". I think that the author could use a good editor who would just tell him to slow down and fully develop a something before he skips off on the next great idea. And to not use rape and torture as everyday occurances.",Conflicted

2627,"From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance BlogAt a GlanceIt took me quite some time to get into this book, but once I did I enjoyed it and all its creepy glory.The GoodAfter accepting a ride home from a stranger, Sam and Lloyd find themselves trapped in a mansion by a deviant madman. With Lloyd catatonic with fear, it's up to Sam to get them out of this mess. If only there wasn't a twenty foot fence keeping them within the property and within the kidnapper's grasp.The Long Weekend was pretty good once it got going. It became very intense once Sam realized that this strange man was not there to entertain them but to do horrible, unspeakable things to them. His best friend Lloyd, being too trusting, lets the stranger separate them into two different rooms, and that's when things really go downhill. Barely escaping the madman's demented plans, Sam is now on a mission to find Lloyd and get them out before they both get killed.I really respected Sam for his tenacity and bravery, especially since he is only 11 years old. He takes charge, risking his life to save his friend and trying to find a way out of their ordeal. Even when Lloyd withdraws into himself, Sam never leaves him behind.  His resourcefulness was astounding. Without Sam's strong determination, I don't think either boy would have had a chance of surviving.I was truly scared for both the boys. We knew so little about the man that took them that I didn't know what to expect from him. This book really plays on your emotions. I went from anxious, to sickened, to hopeful, then aggravated as the story went on. And the ending was perfect. Nothing was left unanswered, it wrapped things up 100%. I still have chills just thinking back to this book.The BadI read the first 3 pages and put this book down and did not pick it up for about a week. I know this is not a YA book but the main character is 11 years old so the writing is very childlike since we are in his point of view. It made it very hard to get into the story. Also, there was way too much backstory in the beginning. I get why Kalhan did it that way, but it really gave a bad first impression.The SnugglyThis book contains implied child molestation, nothing graphic but very unsettling.OverallThe Long Weekend was a powerful and shocking read once it got to the meat of the story. Sometimes it was hard to take, knowing what these boys were going through, but it happens in real life so it's not unrealistic. This thriller was a quick read that left me breathless. Recommended for horror/thriller readers.Quote""Fear made you cold. It made you tremble. Anger made you hot. It made you want to hurt someone.""",Pretty good.

I've seen more writing in a free sample of books than in this.The whole thing can be summed up like this: First person fictional essay on a confused teenager jogging with two people she is friends with that hate each other.

2631,"This was damn near everything that I needed it to be. The problem was that it was too short. Beg for It had everything it needed to be a full length novel, if the author were interested in investing a little more time on plot development. A huge chunk of the e-book is all sex, hot sex, but all sex. Still, I thought Malone did a good job of incorporating plenty of heart. Because of the length the novel felt a little rushed in throwing our hero and heroine together. They've got plenty of back history but we don't really get to experience too much of it because of the novella's brevity.Mya Taylor is in love with her best friend, Milo Hamilton. A hastily made bet on who will get the new account at the ad agency they work for leads to a long, hot weekend during which they admit to wanting more than to be just best buddies. Only, of course, a random willowy, blonde shows up at the door and our short, dark, curvy heroine gets the wrong idea and goes home to pout. What little is left of the novella is spent getting these too wacky kids back together (which turns out to be surprisingly painless).Malone is a strong writer, and unlike much of the other offerings in this category that I've read of late, this was a well-written, solidly edited short. There were some things that I didn't care for, like some of the hero's more cave man actions and the heroine's limp pining, but overall it was a good read. The other thing that I didn't like was the oblique to non-existent references to our heroine's ethnicity. She's described as having loads of curls and with skin from caramel to cinnamon. Now, there's a lot of distance between caramel and cinnamon. I, for one, like the cinnamon reference better. The cover is the only absolute description of the heroine as African-American.I've been reading a lot of self-published Amazon novellas with interracial couples at the heart. Most of them are throw always, but the ones that I really do like highlight the differences between the couples. Sadly, for all that it's better written than most of them, Malone's story lacks that component.",Teh Hotness!

2639,"While Phoebe Deane was a pretty decent read, the typos really took away from the experience and sometimes the author dragged out descriptions of nature, that just weren't necessary.  The book also starts off, kind of slow.  But it picks up a couple of chapters in and it gets really good about 2/3 into the book.  If I could have given this book a 3.5, I would have.The characters were a tad bit ""off-centered"" to me.  Phoebe has the patience of JOB, is a hard worker, loves to read/learn and is quite naive; her brother is a kind man, with intelegent interests, but referred to as mentally slow (later in story) and his wife is a BITTER woman.  Miranda is apparently from the wrong side of the bed and raised by her grandmother (a lady), yet her dialect is that of a slave or lower class and quite hard to follow.

Her past is rocky and I wish I knew more about that, Shara hit a few highlights on the subject but not enough for me to have any real feelings about it.When Cory and Stephanie finaly get together I was left wondering about the months in between them meeting and becoming lovers.

(What kind of dog is Spike?)  Katherine is a sniveling mess a good deal of the time.  Parts of it are just sex scene after sex scene (Which is better written than most Laurel K Hamilton sex scenes, so at least that's a bonus.).

I found the interaction between characters unbalanced: their sparring sounds more bickering and it was not clear to me when they started to see the other in a different light; I didn't feel that the transition from disdain, to understanding and acceptance and then to love was handled smoothly. In addition the last obstacle before the happy ending left me with the strong desire to bash the head's hero with an heavy instrument: the entire situation was absurd and could have been resolved in an heart-bit with a particle of common sense.

2649,"To preface my review, I will definitely say that this book was very well written for a such a short read. The main characters are Jayda who is able to shift to both a wolf and a cougar, her boyfriend Cole - a wolf, and Zane a cougar shifter. As the story excerpt indicates her boyfriend Cole brings out the wolf in her and through his help (intimately) she is able to shift to a wolf, however with him her cougar is latent and vice versa, with Zane she is able to shift to a cougar and with him her wolf is latent. Thse are both men who are head of their respective councils and have a deep-seated distrust for each other..you can see where this is leading!Naturally as the audience, we are privy to Jayda's feelings and the sense of disquiet she feels because although Cole wants to mate with her and she loves him, she is unable to commit to him because she is not only a wolf. We get that she loves Cole and she is torn, especially after meeting Zane, being sexually attracted to him and shifting with him. Ultimately it came to a head where she wants/needs both of them to complete her. I had a problem with the way the author wrote Jayda's reaction when she brought the two men together and had sex with them. I felt like it was all about her...I thought that Jayda's character was selfish because Cole was never given enough time to actually come around to the idea that Jayda's polymorphic state meant that both her animals needed mates. It was like she was there at the finish line in knowing what she needed to feel happy and instead of giving him the time to come around so he could meet her there, she was angry that there was jealous and resentment on his part. Ultimately it worked out, but because I felt disconnected from Jayda, it ruined the story for me!On another note, can anyone recommend an author or books where the opposite happens? What I mean is that I am tired of the same old alien, cyborg, vampire, shifter relationships where the same theme abounds...way too much men and not enough women to go around so of course there is the lucky female with two (or three) hunks after her. I would like to read about a FFM relationship where there is an alien, cyborg, vampire, shifter theme where more females than male presiding and there is a lucky guy who's got two (or three) beauties loving him!!",I would recommend but I had a few problems wholeheartedly liking it!

2651,"""Serial"" is a great little collaborative effort by two entertaining writers.  Chapter one shows the grandfatherly-looking serial killer known simply as ""Donaldson"" torture and kill a hapless hitchhiker that he picks up at a rest stop.  Chapter two shows a woman serial killer named Lucy torture and kill two guys who picked HER up hitchhiking.  Chapter three is serial killer Donaldson giving a ride to serial killer Lucy, and the fun begins.The story is graphic and visceral and not for the squeamish, but don't worry- it's not torture porn.  Jack Kilborn (who's really thriller writer J.A. Konrath) and Blake Crouch are pros who know how to tell a story, not talentless hacks just describing an ax falling and hacking off limbs (not that there are scenes as unimaginative as a simple ax attack here).  Yes, you will graphically be told what implement, say, Donaldson decides to use against his victim, and, yes, you are clearly told what Donaldson does with the implement.  But the facts are related quickly, without excruciating detail.  The rest is all in the reader's head.  Kilborn and Crouch give us what our neurons need to know to get started, and sit back and let us fill in the rest.  That's why it's such a hoot to read some of these other Amazon reviews that complain about the ""too graphic"" nature of ""Serial"".  In the end, these nastily clever guys realize that good horror writing- even graphic horror- ultimately comes from a formula of one part writer and three parts reader.""Serial"" is about the length of a longish story in ""Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine"", and- truth be told- could probably appear there with only a little re-writing to tone it down from its current Hard-R or NC-17 tone.  After all, most of the story consists of interesting character exchanges (lots of dark-tinged banter, especially), moments of clever set-up, and plenty of good suspense... all things that have to do with decent writing and not graphic bloodletting.After the story's over, ""Serial"" is rounded out by a fun, illuminating  chat between the two authors and moody, entertaining excerpts from two of their books, making the whole package good for an hour or two of edgy entertainment on the couch or porch. Even if ""Serial"" goes up to a buck or so from its current bargain price of ""free"", this would still be a worthwhile download for your Kindle.",Here's one that won't make you doze off

However, she has to pick up the bits and pieces of her life, has to get used to the idea of being a widow and has to try to go on with her life.Six years after the death of her husband Jolene is a successful deputy marshal on an elite warrant team but her private life still suffers - she hasn't been involved with any man after her husband's death. Then, all of a sudden, Paul's worst fears seem to come true: an attempt on Jolene's life is made and Paul decides to ""secure"" his wife by taking her to the high security military base he is working. But what thinks Jolene about her husband's ""resurrection""?I would've liked to elaborate more on above summary but was really afraid to spoil too much since the plot was simple and straight forward, without creating any mentionable ups and downs. Except for few pages at the beginning of the novel, the whole book took place in the secret military base. Furthermore, the book didn't have any serious sub-characters, except for two of Jolene's colleagues and one of Paul's, who all made very rare and unmentionable appearances.  That wouldn't really matter if the interaction between the two main characters would've been outstanding and making the change in scenery and characters needless, which really wasn't the case, especially since Paul's  main target was completely one dimensional: he wanted only to get her into his bed and she couldn't resist.The more I read about Paul the less I liked him. By choosing his career he very consciously made the decision to lead a solitarily and withdrawn life, gaining in return for this sacrifice self-fulfillment through his academic achievements. Basically he made the very active decision to barter his private life for his professional life. So far so good, until he decides to marry Jolene against his better knowledge and for one reason only: he wants to get her into his bed.  As if this wasn't selfish enough, he decides to ""reappear"" after six years, without taking his wife's career and private life into consideration. This is no alpha male but just a stupid egoist!This isn't the first book I read from this author, however, I was deeply disappointed and very much surprised by the many 5* ratings it got!  Anyway, maybe I just wasn't in the mood to appreciate a book with an elementary and simplistic storyline, no suspense, no twists and turns, which tried to compensate and focus the reader's interest by  using blunt and badly integrated sex scenes. Nothing else!",Disappointing
2658,"I love Ms. Dohner's other series, so I decided to try this one and was seriously disappointed.The heroine (human) comes to a were town while the mating heat season is in full swing. She's unaware such thing happens so makes mistake, gets into trouble (attempted gang rape) and is saved by the hero. So far so good. Then being her uncle's apple of the eye, she get's a bodyguard, ta-dam, the same poor guy. He's ordered to protect her and not to touch under the threat of being castrated.However, the heroine suddenly decides she wants to get in bed with him, even though she knows about her uncle's orders, threats and character in general. When she doesn't get what she wants, she starts behaving like a spoilt 5-year old brat trying to provoke the hero but gets into near-rape situation again. Then he has to mark her in order to get her out of this mess and she's not happy the guy isn't over the moon about it.I'm all for independent strong-willed assertive heroine but these qualities do not equal stupid stubbornness and creating mess all around you just to get what you want.Will try the second book in the series to see if it improves, probably, or will just wait for next New Species book.",The heroine is absolutely TSTL (too stupid to live) POSSIBLE SPOILERS
2659,"Don't get me wrong; the premise and story were great, well developed and plausible.  The BIG problem with this book, aside from some Kindle formatting issues, which you can overlook easily enough, was that it was written so badly in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc.I don't think that details regarding what someone does in the bathroom were needed, or one of the accused ""scratching"" himself, or an attorney pleasuring himself, by himself, they were so unnecessary, that they really detracted from the story and simply didn't belong.The title leads you to believe that right from the start there's a vigilante at work.  I was 44% into the book before the first vigilante act took place, so the description of the book is a little misleading.I enjoyed the book, and it gets you interested immediately and keeps you interested throughout the book.  It had twists and turns, most of which were unexpected, but it was incredibly hard to get past the elementary level of writing.  If you're going to write a book that you want people to read and enjoy, and you want those same readers to ""spread the word"" to others, and possibly read additional books you might write, for goodness sake, write it well, turn on spell check and proof, proof, proof.  I was astounded at the poor use of grammer, the use of incorrect words, the punctuation was atrocious, and many times I find that reading books written like this almost make you nauseous.I hate to blast the basic writing style, but it is hard to enjoy a book when these things are rampant throughout the story.  The storyline was good, holds your interest and is a fast paced and interesting read.  If you can get past the poor writing style, you'll really enjoy the books premise.  Thank you for reading my review.",Very Poorly Written
2660,Interesting book however I found it a little slow.  I've read the next 2 books in the series and found them very interesting.  I am looking forward to #4.,Book 1
2661,I think that this writer has a good idea--getting a has-been man who is in despair to sit up and start living again. I did like the cast of characters including the bikers. The author could have had a better book without the sexual scenes...Worth a read for free.,"suspenseful, but not super enjoyable"
2662,"I am sorry but I had to put this book away without finishing it and I rarely do that,.it gave me the willies",Gruesome
2663,"The idea for the story was cute however the characters themselves were weak at best and the writing style was downright terrible, I almost hesitated to give it even two stars.Nikias, the hero is described as being a protective, interesting and good guy who is just arrogant and a bit of a hothead. The problem is the only time he speaks in the book he comes across as a manipulative, controlling jerk. The scenes where she supposedly sees the fun sweet side of him she falls in love with are only briefly described in a general way. Diona, the heroine is also described as beautiful, intelligent and strong however again most of her scenes display her as weak willed and pathetically willing to take the crap the hero is dishing out. Because of this I had a very hard time believing this whirlwind love that was supposed to have taken place between them. Lots of sex yes, love...I never really saw it. Even the one scene that had the potential for it, when she saves the girl, is ruined by him acting like a horny teenage boy.However I could have given the book a little more credit if it hadn't been for the horrible grammar and writing style. Constantly changing tenses mid sentence, writing it mostly from a perspective as if the story is recalling a past event but telling it as if its happening in real time. Also I don't know how many times the writer used the word ""had"" but I found myself mentally blocking it out as I read to tolerate the story. It was used once if not multiple times in pretty much every single sentence and often its use didn't make sense...drove me crazy!",Cute premise...horrible execution
2664,"I bought this book because I loved the cover and I try to read any Civil War romance I come across. Unfortunately, I wanted more story. If the book was longer to compensate for all the bedroom activity it would be a much better read. Both the Confederate Colonel and the Southern widow were good characters and relatable, but were only written at a surface level because not enough time was given to development. At least the readers were given memories from their past to help fill in some of the blanks. And the epilogue detracted from the story in my opinion.I like Debra Glass, but this wasn't my favorite read.",Hot Civil War Read... I wanted more Romance
2665,"The title caught my interest.  Reading the free sample made it clear it's probably a book I'd enjoy, but I couldn't even make it all the way through the sample because the punctuation is just so wrong.  I really really want to read this, would even buy it based on the little I read, but every time I see a misplaced comma I cringe and the author descends another notch in my estimation.[Please note, all aspiring writers, commas do not go after ""and"" - I know we talk that way, but that's not proper punctuation; if you're going to go through all the effort to write a book, at least take a gander through Strunk and White.]So please, Dear Author, I beg you, have the punctuation corrected, because I'd really like to enjoy your story [and be able to upgrade my rating to more stars].  An entertaining, fresh voice in the paranormal romance arena is a joy to find, but it's got to be cringe-free reading.","Fresh and entertaining, but unreadable due to punctuation errors"
2666,This was a fun read! The characters left me wanting more which is always a good sign. There was a good amount of sexual tension which I think is part of this book's charm. Believable characters who stuck to their traits. Well written with a good plot!,"Enjoyable, flirty and fun"
2667,"This book was too jumpy and very hard to follow. The flow of the story was very confusing at times. I often found myself retreading just to understand the next point.

2677,"As posted on The Smutty Kitty4 out of 5 LicksWhen I discovered there was a book by Jayne Rylon that I hadn't read yet I knew I needed to rectify the situation immediately.  Dream Machine takes us into the world of Becca's dreams and let me tell you this woman has some sexy dreams about her boss Kurt.  Kurt and Becca make such a great couple because they each spend quite a bit of time fighting the growing love between them-one of my favorite things for characters to do is fight the attraction.  These two may be fighting the love portion of the attraction but thanks to science they are not fighting the sex portion.  lol  Thanks to Becca's wicked dream desires they have all kinds of hot kinky sex.  I'm quite happy to say we get our HEA for Kurt and Becca although the path at the end got very rocky.My favorite part about this book though was Luke.  He is one of those secondary characters that just took over for me.  When he was in the scene he had my complete attention and sometimes even when he wasn't around I was thinking about him.  I'm thrilled to say he recently got his own book,Healing Touch (Play Doctor), come back tomorrow for that review.

2678,"Author and editors should do a better job of proofing -- especially for word usage.  Lots of misuses of ""then"" and ""than,"" ""passed"" and ""past,"" and ""accept"" and ""except.""  These errors were found throughout all three books.Aside from that, the characters were mercurial, and prone to over-blown prose; the dialog was easy to follow, if occasionally overwrought; the philosophical discussions were completely pedestrian (how many times will ""free will"" versus ""fate"" be debated?!?); the characters were sometimes inconsistent, sometimes too stiff, and other times quite engaging; and often the foreshadowing was heavy-handed.Even with all these faults, I enjoyed reading the series.","Frustrating, but generally pleasant light reading"

Reality Creation:101 is a must read for anyone who wants to improve their overall position in life.",BEST ON KINDLE!
2681,"The first thing that grabbed me about this book was definitely the title. I found it intriguing & mysterious, and it made me really excited to get into it. And as you read the story, you realize that Bethany (our main character) not only has to keep a lot of secrets, but she discovers even more.I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but there were a few things that held it back. The story confused me a bit at times, and never quite explained how it was that Bethany could be in two worlds at once. Also, at some points in the book, Bethany spoke in a way that made her sound way too old for her age - especially in her interactions with her siblings.BUT what I did love about this book was the imagination and creativity that went into Chime's world. I loved the idea of an author falling into her world, and especially a world filled with magic & mystery. I absolutely LOVED the idea of Vault 5 (I don't want to spoil it, so read it for yourself!) and I found the Queen's character extremely interesting. Even though she didn't get much time in the story, she was actually a really deep character.",Intriguing and Mysterious
2682,"The story was interesting but the characters were a little hollow. I read the whole book but could have easily not finished it.

2685,"I'm shocked at all the five star reviews. It was a beauty and the beast type book but the beauty apparently wasn't all that beautiful. The most aggravating part was the back and forth between the main characters, should I tell him this, I should have told her that, I want him to kiss me, I don't dare kiss her, over and over. She thought she was ugly, he kept referring to himself as a monster. We get it.The mystery part was so poorly done, I wondered if it was a last minute addition to lengthen the story. The main characters weren't bad, but the story surrounding them was. It could have used an editor, as well.Unfortunately, I couldn't recommend this to anyone.",No go
2686,I gave this book a bottom rating as a warning that although published in 2010 this book has no ending. It is supposed to be book one but you are left hanging at the end.

2689,"This book had particular interest for me because I am currently living in Cambodia and am all too familiar with the landmine problem here. The author had clearly done his/her homework as the story was chock full of information on mines, how they are used and how they are disposed of. The characters were also well developed and the plot moved along quickly with enough unexpected turns to keep me interested.I know that the theme of the 'wounded warrior' who has to fight their own personal demons to solve a crisis is popular almost to the point of cliche' and I found it a bit overworked here with the protagonist's addiction to opiates. Consider this 'House' in military gear trying to stop a raging terrorist rather than an infectious disease. Aside from that, and the somewhat implausible ending, it was a good read worthy of a few hours of your time.",House in Military Gear

It was a good book, no question about it, but it didn't have the feeling of suspense and/or thrill that I was expecting from the description.  There was plenty of build-up regarding the wood, but very little actual action within the borders of the wood.  The story of the 'haunted' wood was more a backdrop (and deus ex machina, I'm afraid) for the story of Izzy and her abusive ex-husband.  Most readers will enjoy the story so long as they aren't expecting something more in line with 'horror'.  The writing was done well, the characters were believeable, though not always likeable (I personally did not LIKE Izzy at all, though I could sympathize with her), and Kindle formatting was fine.  The writing was worth probably 4 stars, but I took one off due to the fact that this was promoted as more of a 'horror' or 'suspense' genre, which it really wasn't.",More of a novel than a scary story

2710,"I really do enjoy Troy Denning's work, I want everyone who reads this review to know this.  I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.  I did like seeing that even in a galaxy far far away that we have sons who want to be like their fathers and get into trouble when they do rebellious things.

The Hero is very indifferent to her and treats her that way.Their is a ritual all brides go thru before the wedding night takes place. Oh, I should mention that sex is as open and accepted as our watching TV is.  Everybody is doing it every where with anyone and every one and no one really cares or shows any jealously.  The bride is shown by her nanny and 3 young studs what she can expect and what is expected of her.

Little do Payce and Gavin know that they are about to become the hunted in this bizarre fantasy being followed by a madman.PI Barrington brings to life a very real future. Her characters are very likable and have a great sense of humor even in the dire situations that they find themselves.

2730,"This story is what I call ""light reading"".  I have not read many Harlequin novels, but this seems to fit in with the format of the others.  There are no major obstacles to overcome and the story line flows quick and easy.  Although the main female character insists that she and her love interest have dynamically different personalities and could never begin a long-term relationship, their chemistry always suggests otherwise.  The shock of the pregnancy washes over the hero rather fast, and he seems to warm to the idea of moving from confirmed bachelor to having a wife and child in record time.  The reunited couple moves past the initial awkwardness of the situation with subtle ease and then seem to settle into a cozy and cute routine.I enjoyed reading this multicultural romance, but wish there was a bit more to the tale -- I wish we could have spent a little more time with the couple during the summer whirlwind romance (that resulted in this unexpected life change) -- I wish we could have learned a little more about the hero and his military career -- I wish their was less time spent on the future mother-in-law's adventures in online dating.  Otherwise, I was happy with this purchase (happy enough to buy it again after I accidentally returned it...don't ask, I have fast figures and a slow CPU).  Going forward, I hope that Harlequin adds more multicultural romances to the line-up of new releases from their main publishing house instead of pushing most of them into the imprints.",Light Reading

His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage, this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.

What she sees in Brisbane is beyond me.  He often seems obnoxious.""Silent in the Grave"" kept my interest.  I might even have rated it alone as 4 stars.  Much of the second book, ""Silent in the Sanctuary"" seemed highly improbable and it involved more than one mystery.  I finished it but never felt it was engrossing and it took me a lot longer to read it.  I probably would rate it as 2 stars.  I don't plan to read the third one any time soon.

There has yet to be a time in this, or his other two &#34;X-Bat&#34; books, where I had to think, &#34;Why am I wasting time with this book?&#34;Truly, there have been other books for which that thought was foremost in my mind, even while reading them.  I read one of Jack Shane's books, the first X-Bat thriller, then read this one.After those two, I started reading a different author's book but couldn't get farther than the first few pages.  So I located this one, &#34;Anarchy's Reign.&#34;  It appears to be the third in this series.I've begun reading Jack Shane's &#34;Anarchy's Reign,&#34; but I've not quite finished it.  That's only because I had two other, very pressing items on my agenda:  work and sleep!  And the kind of work I do gives me a great head start on sleep ...So without further fondue, I hereby recommend Jack Shane's entire series on the X-Bat SpecOps group.  They're a lively, unusual assembly of military types.

Now her childhood big-bad-wolf-nightmares are turning into real life adult fantasies. Is sexy businessman Gray Lupo the answer to her problems, or just a wolf in gentleman's Armani?Who said being eaten by the big bad wolf was a bad thing?Alison Paige has taken Little Red Riding Hood and given it an erotic and amusing twist.  With a strong heroine, a hot older Hero in denial, a spunky Granny, along with a cast of enjoyable characters, Alison really delivers a fun erotic read.  The love scenes were steamy, though some may find a few elements of certain scenes not their style.The fact that the werewolves in this story were much more primal and true to a wolf's nature was refreshing.  However, having said that, I do have to bring to light a couple of cons.  One, I think the story could've lost a couple of side stories which felt like it slowed the story down.  Two, with some of the side stories and elements, there wasn't a true resolution.  Three, Gray Lupo is the Alpha, but the pack/family didn't really treat him as such.  There were times when the manipulation was a bit too much and too brash for the alpha persona Gray was supposed to epitomize.Overall, I would suggest this story as a weekend erotic read.

In this story Maxon's relationship with Daphne seems to be all one-sided, although the story does give a further glimpse into his relationship with his manipulative father and his view on love and finding a wife. The story's only redeeming quality was to reveal Maxon's stifling lifestyle and his need to gain control over his own life.

Unfortunately, while Life Class had an interesting storyline, hot sex scenes, and lots of conflict, I couldn't get into it.  My problem with the story wasn't the story or the conflict, but the characters.  Both Harley and Ryan manipulate each other and are cruel to each other many times.  Harley pretends not to be trying to lure Ryan into his bed, when in actuality he is.  At one point, he furthers his seduction with a move so cynical he lost any chance he had of being likeable in my eyes.  Ryan is indecisive and explosive.  He gets angry at Harley and hurts him both physically and emotionally.  By the end, he's in a position that makes it hard to see if he's with Harley because he cares or because he has to be.

Risks that have finally spilt over to Colt and Heath when Colt comes home early from work one evening and finds Kylie's date getting too rough in the bedroom and hurting her.

Unique in a way, that it uses food, unlike other books that give tips to have better erection using medicine and/or physical methods. For me, the tips given by the author are simple, yet informative and safe due to its natural means. I stumbled upon this nice book when I sawAphrodisiac: Cook Your Way to Sexual Blissin which gives out natural ways to have an exciting sexual pleasure. All in all, I recommend this book.

2789,"Although I enjoyed reading this it would not be on the top of my list to recommend unless you were just looking for a light story to take your mind off every day life for a short time. The main character went from being a strong business woman trying to make partner in her company, to insecure family business owner back in her old hometown. While her cousin constantly went from duress to having  a conscience to ruthless. Of course there's also the possibility that I'm the one getting jaded from reading too many of these types of stories!",Good for a light read

2791,"Third book in ""Triple Trouble"" series, preceded byStorm Warning. There are no further books in the series available on Amazon at the time of this review.""Three Dog Night"" is definitely a sequel to ""Storm Warning"", however there is enough explanation of previous books to allow this one to standalone.Plot:Elain has recently accepted she's mated to triplet Were wolves. She's trying to come to terms with what that means. The wolves just want lots of sex.Comments:- Given this is the third part in a series, it is reasonably long (3900 kindle locations). There is plenty of sex, some action and enough plot to hang the book together.- The story of Elain and her wolves picks up almost a month after Elain was ""marked"", so about two/three weeks from the end of ""Triple Trouble"". Elain is settling into being a ""Shifter Mate"", but still they haven't bothered to explain all the ""rules"" she's supposed to know. Nor really get to know her and her past. Come on guys, if you're supposed to spend the rest of your lives together, shouldn't you at least chat every so often?- Sex is generally m/f, with m/f/m/m (for a committed m/f/m/m relationship). There is also m/m and m/m with voyeurs by secondary characters (aiming for a committed m/m relationship). It is worth noting (as has been said by a previous reviewer) the m/m relationship begins with what amounts to rape. I didn't like Elain's ""marking"" ceremony of Book 1 and thought it was ""forced sex"", but this marking ceremony is even more so. It is an aspect of these books I *hate*.  Similarly, the ""hunts"" are difficult, since they are wrapping sex in fear, excitement, apprehension, lust, but absolutely no love. She is setting the men up to force her (which they don't want to do yet allow their primal/feral parts to participate in). It is the whole point of the hunt, submission on capture. That said, it (mostly) works within the plot, the submission parts of ""Shifter"" relationships.- Also, as I have commented on the other two books, the bedroom scenes are ordinary. I don't know what the author is doing wrong but it just isn't HOT. It is frequent, it is lusty, it is in different places and positions, but it doesn't grab me. Often Elain is going into it with a ""just get it over with"" attitude; she enjoys it well enough but would rather be elsewhere. It is a shame, because one of the requisites of ""menage romance"" is they always try to make her happy and don't do it just to fulfill the male needs (otherwise she would never sleep!). There is a demonstrably loving, caring aspect of the sex which seems to be missing. So, lust not love?- More so than previous books, ""Three Dog Night"" finishes on a cliffhanger.Opinion:This is a difficult book to recommend. The plot/story is getting more interesting, with a blood pledge making itself known, unexplained murders, ""creepy"" stalkers and mystery parentage. BUT (and it's a big BUT), the sex scenes are not getting better. The forced m/m marking was world appropriate but nowhere near loving, lust not love. The setting up of the men through the hunts is horrid, lust not love. The desired submission of a (once strong) woman to their Alpha male way of dealing with the world is sad. But it isn't beyond the standard expectations of a Shifter Romance.So, do I want to read Book 4? If it was out right now, probably. To wind up the cliffhanger. Will I look for it down the track? Probably not. I will remember the harsh sex aspects of these books and forget the interesting plot arc. Disappointing.",Getting to know your Shifter Mates with questionable sex scenes

2797,"Oddly, I found the story line engaging but I was disappointed by the fact that it is a precursor to a second book and I really couldn't see the point for a second book.  There were a number of interesting themes to the story but I am not inclined to read the second book because there was no sense of an overarching goal that had to be reached or some kind of surprise ending.  Characters were interesting but except for the main female they lacked significant depth.  The genesis of Malcolm introduces the idea of visitors from another planet but again it was not so interesting that I will be inclined to look for the second book.  In fact I read Uprising a few months ago and had to read it again before removing it from my kindle to be sure that I hadn't accidentally missed reading it.  I guess the lack of any real excitement in the story made it forgettable, hence, at best it was OK.",At best it was OK

He had planned to woo her properly, but an over aggressive wolf changed her instead. Even though Kari puts up a fight about becoming his mate, he knows she is changing her mind with each moment they spend together. As quickly as Kari realizes her true feelings and destiny to be mate to the Alpha, she also has someone wanting to kill her.I liked this quite a bit, but I have read a few other shifter stories that are similar. I liked Andreas a lot, Keri is a hoot and the betas are swoon worthy. All and all pretty good story.",How can you go wrong with a Lauren Dane Paranormal

2802,"I have a hard time reading on-line for enjoyment and I don't own one of those portable readers yet.  That's to explain why it took me quite a long time to read this volume.Once I did get to reading, I found this book virtually hard to put down.  Sage is a wonderful fantasy kingdom described for the reader by the main character. Demetria is a plant wizard with the ability to control and speak to plant life, which does tend to make them grow very well.  Her husband, Ward, is a dungeon master who can control stone.All of the inhabitants of Sage have some type of magical affinity, whether to plants, stone, animals, and a variety of other talents.The Rats who live in a neighboring kingdom, however, are not amiable with the humans of Sage.  Therein lies much of the conflict in these stories. In the first tale, the Rats have sent a plague of rotten mold into Sage.  Who better to fight this menace than Demetria, the master gardener? With great personal sacrifice, Demetria, assisted by other wizards, fights off the slime threatening her land.In the second story, Demetria and Ward must rescue their son from the Rat Kingdom. They get some surprising help from those believed to be the guilty parties.Okay, I'm writing this review before I've read the third tale, however, I will absolutely do so and know I will enjoy the heck out of it.  I've become a Demetria fan.  I look forward to seeing more tales from the land of Sage.  But, Maria, let's get this book in print so I can take it to bed with me.  Now, that's where I can read for enjoyment.One last note for Maria: Fifty-five is NOT old!",Nothing like a bit of sage...
2803,Boring! Just like the others!  I was very disappointed with the lack of originality.  Sex scenes just OK.  How about a more realistic heroine?,Ho Hum!!
2804,"*****POSSIBLE SPOILERS*****After reading some of the reviews on this book, I almost didn't read it.  I am not a fan of relationships between people who have large gaps in age, especially if they are minors.  Well, after reading the book, that wasn't what bothered me the most.  What I felt detracted the most, from the very intriguing storyline, was the utterly ignorant reason for the camp.  An abstinence camp!  Seriously?  Educate and abstain?  I got the irony that in the end they were all ending up pregnant, but it was just stupid.  It actually took away from the storyline, and was ridiculous at best.  There they had huge, vast, bunches upon bunches, of birth control supplies, but they ended up pregos in the end anyway.  Some of the kids attending the camp were as young as twelve!  This was just a really stupid part of the story that only a man could come up with.  And, by the way, diaphragms are not even remotely like condoms.  You can't just take a supply to hand out later to your friends.  They have to be fitted by a specialist to the exact size of the cervix.  You get a prescription for it.  After it comes in, you have to take it back to the doctor for the fitting.  I was just shaking my head when I read some of the stuff about having a large supply of condoms and diaphragms to give out to their friends later.  Condoms...maybe, but not diaphragms.  If this author wants to improve this story, just make the camp a regular camp.  If you can put aside the absolute stupidity involved in the creation of this Sex Ed Camp, then the rest of the book is good.  DON'T . GO. INTO. THE. FOG. !!!","Pretty good, but needs some work"

But I remind myself that it's entertainment that we are after and this one certainly delivers.",Think Dessert
2807,"The story had potential, much as the characters. But neither ever came to fruition. It was obvious that the writer couldn't even get inside the heads of his characters, so how he expected a reader to do so is beyond me. A good editor might be able to pull this from the scrap heap, because there are some good story elements worth salvaging. The grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors might have been caused by the conversion process, so I did my best to ignore them and am only mentioning them so future readers can be prepared. I will probably read the second in the series if only because I truly want to see this writer improve on the craft.",Cutting Edge #1

2810,"This review is split into two sections. The first section has to do with the subject matter and how it is presented. The second has to do with how it was formatted for Kindle.Part 1I picked this up for my Kindle because I teach The True Story of Hansel and Gretel. The main characters in the book flee from the Bialystok ghetto, and it is difficult to find detailed infromation.Midler's story almost seems designed as if it was something he told and then typed, which is possible because he did present to a class in CA. This makes the style at times slightly disconcerting, especially towards the end of the book. Midler chronicles his life during the war, as the only member of his immediate family to survive as well as his experiences during the birth of Isreal, his travels to the United States, and his return to Europe. The book not only allows the reader a view into not only the war but into the current situtation in the Middle East. Not only that, but Midler ties the events into current events.Part 2However, the reason why I gave it three stars instead of the four it deserves is that the Kindle edition is very badly formatted. There repeatitive FFFFFFFF (multiple letters), huge chunks of paragraphs are repeated and chapter headings sometimes appear in the middle of sentences. This doesn't happen on every page, but it happens enough to be very, very annoying. The formatting lets down the importance of the story, for this is something that should be read and should be used in schools.",Important read but some minor problems
2811,"This was an unexpected bonus when I downloaded the book free. Now I am hooked, the preface mentions several books in the ""Hummingbird"" series and I am going to have to find out which order these books chronologically fall into since that is the way I would like to read the series.",At least a 4+
2812,"As much as I love fantasy, I don't read a lot of that genre nowadays, since it's so hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, with so many authors trying to be the next Tolkien or Rowling. Nevertheless, I had seen some favorable comments about ""Sage: Tales from a Magical Kingdom,"" and I noticed that it was a short book, so I downloaded it for my Kindle.It's a nice concept. The author, Maria E. Schneider, has created a mythical magical kingdom and introduced the reader to this realm through three short stories featuring the main characters. In a different twist, instead of having a world inhabited by ordinary people with a scattering of wizards, witches, and the like, in Sage, everyone is a magician of sorts, with each person specializing in a certain form of magic. The first character we're introduced to is Demetria, an aging grandmother who is a Master Gardener, having the ability to communicate with and influence plants. Demetria's husband, Ward, is a Stone Master, who has the power to manipulate stones (which comes in very handy in one of the stories).In the first of the three stories, ""Toil Trouble and Rot,"" Demetria discovers that the kingdom's crops are rotting due to a magic fungus introduced by Sage's arch enemies, the Rats who live just beyond Sage's borders. Demetria and Ward, with their children, Gavin and Xylia, set off to determine the extent of the damage and to destroy the fungus. With help from their friends, each of whom has a special magical power, they go in harm's way to battle the fungus, which is as deadly to humans as it is to plants.""Dungeons and Decay,"" the second story, is about a search for Demetria and Ward's son Gavin, who is missing and is feared to have been captured by the Rats in the kingdom of Ratdom. In ""Call to Arms,"" the third story, Demetria and Ward and their friends are involved in some nastiness by creepy crawlers from the Slithering Kingdom.Sage is a magical kingdom, but the magic is white magic, or earth magic, where the human inhabitants are finely attuned to their natural surroundings and can subtly influence and communicate with objects like trees and stones and animals. There are no wizards hurling lightning bolts or casting evil spells in Sage, which was a relief from the typical fantasy story. In that sense, Sage is reminiscent of an earlier time in history when people were more aware of the natural world and their surroundings. Demetria, Ward, and the others in Sage are interesting characters and certainly sympathetic ones as they go about protecting their land from the dangerous, evil creatures who surround them.Ms. Schneider's writing is very polished and professional, and I found no spelling or grammar errors. Also, the Kindle formatting was perfect. I take neither of these for granted, and the author obviously took a great deal of care in editing, the bane of many authors today.I'm not sure what kind of reading audience ""Sage"" is targeted toward, but in my opinion, it's suitable for children through adults. There are some scenes that might frighten a very young child, but any kid who made it through Harry Potter would certainly be okay with ""Sage.""My only negative comment - and it's a very minor one - is that there are only three stories in the book. The magical realm that Ms. Schneider has created certainly invites more stories, possibly even a full-length novel about Sage and its people and their relationships with other lands and people beyond its borders.In the fantasy genre, it's getting harder and harder to find new books that are both original and well written. Maria Schneider has written a winner with ""Sage.""",A fantasy winner!
2813,The book was okay with a little tweaking and what nots... I would ready the next book to see where the story is going.,It was okay
2814,"It wasn't bad but it could have been better. It's a short story and it reads like one too, the story just seemed to go by pretty quick. I thought it could have been much better and was a bit disappointed. I've really enjoyed all her other books.",OK..
2815,"I was so excited to read the series of the Buckhorn brothers after seeing what great reviews it got and since I liked one of Foster's other books I bought the bundle.The first story in the series is about Sawyer, the oldest brother.  He's a sexy, companionate doctor who's also a loving father and amazing brother.  The story starts with him having to safe Honey after she runs her car into his fence.  He's instantly attracted to her.  The story has him wanting to find out about her and she wanting to get away from him and his brother's because she's in danger and doesn't want to endanger them.  Honesty, I was so bored reading the story.  I couldn't stay interested, I didn't care what Honey's danger was and then Sawyer somewhat was bipolar to me.  He was practically keeping Honey at his house since she was in danger and he didn't want her hurt, yet she wanted to leave and he wouldn't let her.  At times he would shake her wanting to get his words through to her, but he wasn't a violent person according to his brothers.  There were so many other things about the story that drove me nuts.  Sawyer wanted Honey to stay, but wasn't going to tell her, Honey said she felt safe with Sawyer, but wouldn't tell him anything about her big danger mystery, Sawyers brother's were always interrupting him and Honey during an intimate time, and then when a big moment came between them that would have been so much sweeter in private it's done in a causal way with his brother's all around.  Overall it just wasn't what I expected or hoped the story would be.The second story is about Morgan, the second brother.  He's the hunky Sheriff.  In his story he fights the urges to become involved with Misty, Honey's sister.  His story was much better to me than Sawyers.  I was more interested in it and Morgan didn't switch as much in personality.  However, he did mess with Misty's car when she wanted to leave and I didn't really like that he did that.  Seemed juvenile.  His scowling got old after a while, but that was just his personality.  He acted tough, but he was a big softy.  Overall it was a decent story.Gabe's story is third, but he's the youngest brother.  He's the sexy, layback, fun loving brother.  His story was great.  He meets Elizabeth who is the complete opposite of Gabe.  She's prissy, a bookworm, inexperienced, and nave.  Gabe and her clash during the book, but also have a big attraction to one another.  Gabe takes it upon himself to show Elizabeth how to have some fun in life.  This story was a little different than the other two since Elizabeth is different from Honey and Misty.  It was a fun, sexy story that showed how opposites attract.Jordan, the third brother, was the last story.  He's the sexy, calm, vet.  His story was slightly different from the rest.  He meets Georgia, who is a dancer at a bar, divorced, takes care of her mother, and had two children.  Sparks fly right away between them.  Despite Jordan not liking Georgia being a dancer, he never tried to force her to quit and accepted her for who she was and what she had to do to take care of her kids.  I was worried his story was going to be short and he was a great guy so I was glad his story turned out to be complete.  His book was probably my second favorite after Gabe's.Casey, Sawyer son, was also more involved in this story and there's one he's in called Enticing.Overall the series started out a little rocky, but ended up great.  All four brothers have great qualities about them and some flaws.  At times in any of the stories things became predictable.  Also it seemed like every brother fell instantly in love with the woman in their story.  There wasn't a lot of leading up to them realizing they had feelings, it happened right away every time.  But in the end, you can't help but fall in love with each of them.","Started rocky, ended great"

2825,"Can't say I've subscribed yet, but I have picked up an occasional issue of Reader's Digest on the Kindle.  It's a good mix of light feature pieces (an entertaining profile of actor Pierce Brosnan was a good read) and long, detailed investigative articles (good one on the airline industry in the same issue).  You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.  If there's one criticism I have of Kindle blogs and magazines, it's visual sameness.  The New York Times looks like Newsweek which looks like The Philadelphia Inquirer, etc.  But Reader's Digest on the Kindle looks like, well... Reader's Digest.  You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.  I guess it's a small point (as content is really the most important thing), but it's nice seeing a Kindle magazine that looks truly different from other Kindle magazines.  With luck this will be the beginning of a trend.But, yeah, give an issue a shot.  Even if you usually read weightier fare on your Kindle, you may just find the content and visual flair of Reader's Digest on the Kindle to be an occasional refreshing change.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation and functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.","Engaging material, with graphics that stand out"

Why would a woman who's family had been killed and she herself tortured by werewolves chose one as a lover especially when they tried and failed to commit genocide and take over the world?

I couldn't read the rest of the series fast enough.  I'd stay up late at night and rush to buy the next one.  The write up that leads up to the next book, leaves me wondering if I should buy that one or not, I think it goes off in another direction.

Espinoza establishes that Josh wants Peter but is afraid to act on his desires. So when Peter makes a move, the resulting scene is long and slow and detailed.CON:- Like most short stories, this one fell flat for me because I couldn't help comparing it to what it could have been if the characters had had more room to develop.Overall comments: The guys here are sweet, and for readers who like short stories, this one's probably a good choice.

2833,"I first read Norton's Galactic Derelict as a youth/teenager.  I had never read any other of Norton's works.  Funny how I hadn't realized that she was a juvenile writer.  I do not consider this to be a bad thing.  The work is clean and straight forward.  Simple and interesting to read.  Included in this set are two &#34;western/cowboy&#34; type stories which are independent but lean heavily on each other. (the problem with reading on a  kindle is going back for research, I can never remember titles)  The true western is not my kind of reading.  The companion story of the civil war is very good. (Ride Rebel Ride, maybe)  Also hidden in the SCI-FI is a mystery/ghost story set in the south.  Different for me (I'm a heavy SCI-FI fan) but quite good as well.",Comfortable easy reading
2834,"This book left me wishing it had been edited by a professional.  The writing is light and fun and the plot was good.  Unfortunately there were too many characters telling the story.  Each had redeeming qualities that could have been developed making the reader care about the character's fate. Yet it would have taken too many pages to keep it light. I believe a few story lines should have been left out and more time spent digging into the personalities of a select few.  In my opinion there were many odds and ends which didn't need to be told and many that did and weren't.This book has great potential and if rewritten could be quite successful. I liked this writer well enough I will check back in a few years to see if she has developed her style into something wonderful.  Offering it for free was a good idea and I hope the reviews help her work on becoming a better story teller.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this particular book to anyone.",So much potential
2835,"It's a short story that's meant to be entertaining and HOTT and it is succeeds in being both. If you go into it looking for the next ""Great American Novel"" you will be disappointed but if your looking for something fun and characters that are ridiculously likable, you'll get what you pay for. It's a simple story that doesn't throw you for any curves or crazy adversity but for 90 something pages, what more could you ask for? It's worth the read, I wish there was a part 2 I would so read it. The characters are too fun and the sex scenes are the best verbal porn I have read in a minute.",AWESOME for What it is
2836,"I had no idea this fell into the gay/lesbian genre, but even if I had I wouldn't have expected this book.  This book is an adolescent gay wetdream.  The protagonist serially rapes everyone who works for him and they supposedly love it.  His violent take on sex, his utter apartness from his hapless waiters and busboys and cooks, his overweening pride in his cookery, all created such an unattractive story that within a few pages I sent it back off into the ether from which it came.  Bad book, bad, bad book!  Down there, I say sir.  It reminds me of an unruly pet.",I should have read the reviews
2837,"I started out this series so looking forward to learning more about KY horse country.  Very disappointing.  Have learned my lesson, I won't purchase a whole series until I read the first 2 books.  Never written a disappointing review before, sorry to the author.",Had such great hopes for this series
2838,"I really enjoyed this whole series, and wish there were more.  I also read the Bear one, and can't wait til she comes out with the next in that series, which kinda continues this one.  They aren't too long, but neither do you feel cheated by brevity.  This one involves an eye doctor and a legally blind puma with ""ex issues"".  There is plenty of intrigue and hot protective feelings going on.  And I really especially enjoyed that these books all allow further glimpses into the characters met in previous books.  Very enjoyable!",Love love love
2839,"The author has real writing ability; I can't stress this strongly enough.  She has what they call: ""Turn of phrase.""  But the running internal monologue of Maud, the main character, got old after the first half.On the positive side, I liked all the characters, and lots of the vignettes were believable when thinking about small-town life.  But a bunch of vignettes strung together didn't make a workable book for me.  The theme of The Muse lost and The Muse found wasn't strong enough to carry the book.I would be very interested in reading other work by this author, whose talent is not in question.",The author has real talent
2840,"Just not my style, although the plot did catch & keep my attention. My vision of life and Hell is not that of Dante.  I almost changed my mind, and almost began to enjoy the philosophy contained in the story from when Dante in the Inferno was introduced, through to the story's end, but this story was just too dark and depressing for my taste.","Just ""weh"""
2841,"This is an erotic sci-fi romance written in third person. The heroine comes from Earth, and she has developed a way to manipulate DNA. Her expertise is in high demand, especially from two warring nations who want her to cure their citizens of a deadly virus. She is kidnapped and thus begins her adventure.This story might skirt close to forced sex for some readers with the heroine's desire artificially high. There are two lovers for the heroine and quite a few love scenes amongst the plot action.I found this easy to read with the writing and plot smooth. It's the first in a series. 3.5 stars for me",A Sci-fi Romp

2843,Just an awesome kilndle paper. The content cannot be beaten. Great writing and all around coverage of the news. Just way too costly at $20.00 per month. $5 more than the next costliest paper. I wanted to continue my subscription but there are way too many other papers out there from $6 to $10 per month. Would give it 5 stars but for the cost.,Fantastic BUT way too costly
2844,"I found this books to be quite enjoyable. The main character was drawn quite well and seemed to be a real person, rather than some two-dimensional character. I liked the fact that unlike most fantasy heroines, she isn't a young miss. She is the mother of two teenaged sons and a devoted wife of some years. She had a history and a background upon which to draw from.In this book, her husband has gone missing. Rather than accept the inevitable, she gathers up her courage to go look for him. At no time does her personality undergo a radical change where she is suddenly in possession of unique fighting skills or magical power. Instead, she muddles through as best she can, much as anyone else would. I think that it is this touch of ""realism"" that helps to make the book. The events are low key and very believable - for a fantasy book.",A nice solid fantasy
2845,"WTH:  there are so many inconsistencies in this story and scenes that you make cringe:- the female lead is supposedly devastated by her 4-way with the brothers back in high school days that she cuts them off.  This is the whole premise of her resistance to them yet it is also related that as a teenager she and her one of the brothers would openly have sex in front of the other brothers (oh but the other brothers were told to turn their backs so no worries there, yeah right).- she quickly succumbs to having sex with her old boyfriend out in the open (uh, she's so worried about people noticing her sex life, what about the ranch hands who can see the pool area?)- really thought she and the brothers came off as totally dumb that they never practiced birth control (they wanted to keep it exciting), you just can't respect or appreciate characters that stupid, particularly when they're in their mid-20s- the ending orgy scene with the brothers' best friend was just bizarre- the sex she had with her boyfriend in the past had to have been when she was 16/17 and there was a lot of it; that just made me squirm",I made a mistake buying this one....
2846,I liked the change of not being a skinny girl but the story is rather short and only has one major love piece.  The story is different but still cliche.,It was ok.  Not something  I would recommend
2847,"I read Cade's Cove and absolutely loved it, I couldn't hardly put it down.  Raven Mocker has the same characters which is normally something I like, but i had trouble connecting with them this time.  I found this story hard to imagine, which I didn't have any trouble with Cade's Cove.  Maybe I'm just not into such deep haunted stories.  I like to be able to think maybe it could happen but I just couldn't make that leap with The Raven Mocker.",Not as good as the first one
2848,"Sacred Fate by Eresse is set in a hermaphroditic society with lashings of fantasy and rather epic world building. The story was pretty engrossing and a lot of that is down to the world she's created and solid story telling. I did get a little lost when I started it due to the many characters initially introduced and it was difficult to distinguish between them. I liked the story for the most part, but found the Lassen very hard to warm to and Rohyr almost too overbearing. An interesting and unique story.",Unique

2850,"I just love this series and am continuing to read the next in line.  Lady Julia's unusual relationship with the man who helped her solve her husband's murder (he is somewhat dark and stuggles with life), her Shakespear loving father, nutty brothers and most unique sister, all make for a wonderful melange of characters; the mystery almost becomes unimportant.  Read this series; enjoy the flavor of the Victorian age and meet some really interesting folks.  You'll want to go back in time!",Excellent series
2851,"I've appreciated all of the characters and how believable they are.  The plot is very interesting.  I stayed up and read since I did not want to put the book down...Well, I didn't want to close my Kindle :)  I have already purchased the rest of the series.  Lauren, please write quicker.",I've enjoyed this series
2852,"I enjoyed this book. It was interesting and very different from what I expected. I thought it was a romance novel but it was more of a thriller.  I didn't connect with the characters like I usually do with Heather's books, but it still was worth reading.",interesting
2853,"The story is interesting: a middle class, educated, extremely successful black nonfiction writer falls for an up and coming white rapper after they meet backstage at the Letterman show.The story is very good, even sweet in parts. And you genuinely believe the struggle Caroline is going through trying to square her attraction to someone so different, and the portrait of Rick as a struggling artist tormented by writer's block, a troubled past, and his attraction to a woman so unlike his groupies - so out of his league. The author's use of dialogue to tell background and give insight into characters is ambitious, but not very well executed. Most of the time it comes off stilted and as if you walked in to the middle of a conversation - and not in a juicy way. But it's promising and with more practice this is a literary device that works beautifully. It's definitely a skill worth fine tuning.That said, the author has a great ear for dialogue and cadence, so wading through some awkward passages is worth it. The romance brings the heat.  I'll definitely check out more of her books to see how she stretches as a writer. [Really, with the right editor this book would be golden.] As a black woman with a white husband, IR romances are the best kind.","Excellent story, Not the best execution, but promising"

2855,"FBI Special Agent Alex Ware and his partner, Special Agent Shawn Matthews are in deep trouble. Deep undercover to try to nail a particularly offensive weapons trafficker who doesn't trust nor do business with sexually straight people, they're forced into an intimacy that Alex hadn't anticipated - but what really makes him worry is just how much he enjoys the six month deep cover operation. What shocks him is when his Aussie partner and friend, Matthews, comes clean on both his bi-sexuality AND his interest in Alex. An interest that supersedes any work-related cover op.And from that point on, Alex's life - as neurotic and repressed as it was - turns on its ear and becomes uncomfortable, uncertain, and wracked with yearning. In short, utterly unrecognizable.Shawn is adorable in his open devotion to Alex, and Alex is quirky and frustrating in turns as he struggles with his fear and sexual confusion. As a character driven cop thriller, their relationship is the best part of Matter of Necessity.It's a solid short story, but it could have been truly great had there been more depth and detail given on their undercover assignment and fleshed out to a full length novel. The glossed-over introduction to the thug they're trying to bring down lessened the tension of the cop thriller aspect of the story. I also would've liked a bit more detail on the physical aspect of Shawn and Alex's relationship.",Fun and Endearing

2857,"Before I even ordered my Kindle, I read as much as I could about other user's experiences with it. That convinced me that it was a MUST to have some sort of cover right off the bat.Reading reviews of the various covers I decided the Belkin looked like the one that would probably suit me best, so when I ordered the Kindle I ordered the case right along with it. That was the right decision.I don't know what ""smell"" is being talked about, there's no odor to it at all that I can detect, and it provides just the right cover for my new best friend.

2862,"This book is about a community of witches(or persons with magic powers) who begin to lose select members to a murderer. It's a decent plot, the characters are likeable, and the steamy scenes are hot enough, but it becomes way to simplistic in the end. It turns into a bad Scooby-Doo episode were the murderer steps forward and explains all there reasons and then is just taken away....umm yawn boring. There are some confusing paragraphs off and on where you don't know who is talking and who they are referring too otherwise the author can put together a decent sentence.

Like a dark Alice in Wonderland, poor Two falls down the rabbit hole of vice and is mysteriously rescued by Theroen. Theroen, as anybody can guess, is a vampire and he introduces her into a dark world of violence and suspense. Readers are kept on the edge, by not knowing how characters would react and whether there would be indeed a happy ending for the characters. The ending is rather open ended, which I suppose gives a good platform for a sequel, but is not as satisfying.",4 stars for originality

2869,"I would highly recommend this classic to everyone from young teens to our most senior adults.  Warning it is a long, involved tale that can't be read in one evening.  Since every character is a man, it is a less than sentimental journey.  Though they are definitely some tearful scenes.  One character is a former slave, but is treated as the others' equal though somewhat condescendedly.  I enjoyed looking back at a culture and customs that are long gone.

2870,"I subscribe to both Analog Science Fiction and Fact and [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].  My Kindle subscriptions, delivered via the Kindle app on my iPad, save me from myself.  Instead of hunting down magazines at the bookstore--or wondering where they disappeared to from the mail--I just wait for them to show up.  Nice, low-fuss delivery.  And then instant reading gratification.Analog has about half of the science fiction content of its competitor.  It makes up for this with more information from the ""Fact"" side of the fence.  The factual articles, editorials and letters to the editor are interesting and occasionally very interesting.  They wouldn't stand on their own, but are worth the subscription price when bundled with the fiction.My personal take:  I like reading on devices like the iPhone and iPad that also hold a lot of legitimate, technical information.  Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I think I'm getting away with it, but I do enjoy reading Analog and Asimov's in a long, boring, all-hands work meeting.The recommendation:  If you only subscribe to one Kindle magazine for science fiction, make it [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].

The female was just a weak chic that I couldn't like at all, and the guy was just kind of there...didn't like him, didn't dislike him. Just really didn't care. The story was bland and uneventful. The only thing that happened was when her boss finally crosses the line and starts groping her. Jake saves the day but then Mia isn't sure of she's going to quit because she really needs the job (excuse me...so you'll just go ahead and have sex with your boss then? Because that's what it seems like). Jake finally convinces her to quit by promising to take care of her (see what I mean my weak). So she quits but doesn't nothing about the sexually harassing boss.

2874,"With a length that skirts the boundaries between what I would consider a short story and novella, If You Believe introduces us to Aubrey Mathison, owner of the coffee shop Bean There, Done That, and Chief of Police Price Delacroix. Aubrey is still damaged from the betrayal of her now ex-husband, and since their divorce she doesn't have relationships with men. She dates and has sex. That's been working out well for her until her life takes a bit of a turn. Suddenly the homeless man across the street is spouting predictions that come true, her coffee shop goes up in flames, and Price Delacroix meets her, wants her, and refuses to be just one of her other men.There's no doubt that the heat between them is incendiary and the sex scenes smoking hot. The story is tightly compact, but due to the length, we get a much better idea of Aubrey as a character than we do Price, who never seems to develop much beyond superficial eye candy. I've read other novellas of this length that focused more on both character's definition, and realize that my preference lies in that area. I'm not criticizing this story, don't get me wrong. I think it was comprehensive, given length-constraints, in detailing Aubrey's character enough to lend her believability, and I enjoyed seeing her interact with her friend the hairdresser and the guardian angel. In fact, had Price's character been given just a bit more definition, I would have really liked this story. As it stands, I think it's better than okay, but just lacked a bit for me to make it truly enjoyable. The sex, though, was stellar. 3.5 Stars.",Sizzling...Believe It

2883,"This book begins with an overview of how your body's pH level can alter your general feeling of wellness, as well as inhibit or cause/allow certain illnesses and diseases to take hold. It discusses the causes and contributing factors to wonky pH levels. There are lists of foods that are alkaline and acidic. The text generally advocates eating more vegetables, green powders, and drinking freshly juiced fruits and veggies, which is something I can get behind. Next it covers minerals and other supplements you can take to restore balance, and exercises and other ways to deal with stress (which can affect your pH levels). It would have been nice to see more footnotes or sources throughout the text, as I've learned to be critical unless there are reputable sources and research done on the subject matter. I still think the information is really interesting, if only because it's another way to understand the amazingly complex machine known as the human body.The book is pretty short overall, but it explains its purpose clearly and presents the information about how you can begin to correct your body's pH. The writing is clear and direct, and is essay-like. It's well edited.People looking for alternative solutions for common (non-serious) ailments might enjoy the information presented in this book. I do urge people to seek the advice of licensed medical professionals for anything that seems serious. Still, it might be worth it to try some things that this book talks about, just for general health reasons.","Short, but has interesting information on how pH affects your health"
2884,"In the year 3478, the Burning War has left Earth - or Terra as it's now known - a devastated, backward world that's lost three-quarters of its population to not only war, but to tsunamis, earthquakes, and a plague that would have entirely wiped out humanity had the Triune Goddess Morrigunia not interceded. Floods and earthquakes have reduced the size of what used to be the United States by half. The people exist now in a futuristic ""old west"" in which the large cities and their machinery of old lie in ruin. In what had been the vast Midwest, the Southwest, and Southeast, the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords -- three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy. Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra. To eradicate them before this happens, the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunia's Reapers.Reapers are forces to be reckoned with. Tall, black-haired, and inordinately handsome and well-built, these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men. Neither vampire nor werewolf, but a combination of both, they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird. Their senses are enhanced, and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things. Tough, unsympathetic killers, they'll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates. Ultimately, they are the final word of law in the Territories, and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people. Yet the people they've dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blood-drinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the blood-thirsty Rogues.Flash back to 3473...When Reaper Bevyn Coure walked into the White Horse Saloon in the seedy little town of Orson in the Armistenky Territory, he was looking to do one thing. Get stinking drunk so he couldn't feel either his loneliness and the grief eating away at him over the loss of a close friend. The last thing he expected to find was the one woman who called out to his damaged soul.Lea Walsh was hard at work cleaning tables when the handsome Reaper walked in, swaggering, as if he owned the place, up to the bar and the whiskey bottle the saloon owner automatically placed before him. She could barely keep her eyes off him. Though she feared him, the sight of him stirred her desires. And then his deadly eyes met hers in the mirror over the bar. She watched his lips moved as he asked for her. She wasn't a whore, but even she knew you didn't refuse a Reaper what he wanted. When she followed him upstairs to his room, she knew her life was about to change for the better.What neither knows, however, is that danger tracks Bevyn's every move, and Lea may not have a say in whether or not she'll be able to keep her handsome Reaper once the Amazeen warrioress and Nightwind Penthesilea makes her move.In this tender love story, Charlotte Boyett-Compo once again weaves her marvelous magic to bring together a Reaper and the woman the Goddess has placed in his path. Lea is the one woman destined to assuage Bevyn's loneliness and ease the memories of his haunted past. Her own loneliness calls to Bevyn. Nevertheless, he doesn't want a woman complicating his life. Discarded at birth and raised harshly by priests to enter the priesthood, a woman tortured him and then finally burned him alive because he would not forsake his celibacy and submit to her. Then the Goddess Morrigunia thrust him into a second life of lonely servitude as one of her Reapers. To his way of thinking, Mo Regina is enough to deal with. But Lea is a temptation, one his lonely soul hungers to possess.Initially, Bevyn merely wants Lea as a companion, and although she's willing to give him more, she could definitely be happy with Bev as her protector...just as long as he doesn't make her into what he is. I love that these two spend their first night together just holding each other and filling up the empty holes of each other's loneliness, but Lea's adverse reaction to taking one of Bev's fledgling hellions wasn't a plus for me in her likeable column. But of course it doesn't stand in Bevyn's way of making her his mate. That he doesn't ask her to marry him however is understandable. How can he offer everything to a woman who won't accept every facet of him?Once things heat up between Bev and Lea, these two virgins manage to come up with some imaginative sex play. There's one scene set in a stable that will leave you panting and fanning your face! The secondary characters: Sheriff Buford Gilchrist, Widow Cornelia Jones, Riley the gambler, Lord Kheelan, and others add depth and focus to the story, but there was something missing from this fifth installment to the WesternWind series. Despite being highly emotional, which I always love about a Charlee Compo book, I wasn't satified with the pairing of Bevyn and Lea in Her Reaper's Arms. I just couldn't understand why Lea wanted to be with Bevyn if she found his revanent symbiont so distasteful.While this story is technically a standalone, I recommended you read the WesternWind books in order for better reader enjoyment and understanding. -- This review belongs in its entirety to TwoLips Reviews, LLC.",A Tender Love Story
2885,"This was on okay read, not horrible, but not exhilarating either. The story is basically about mental illness and the stigma attached to that in the United States. It was well written in the sense of being able to understand the author's point, but not in the sense of a highly entertaining read. Argus, the main character, was memorable in his attempt to uncover the truth of his ordeal, while at the same time fighting his personal demons. I did like his character very much throughout the entire book. Sarah, Argus's wife, was pretty shallow in my estimation, considering she knew of his mental disorder when they married. The villain, when revealed in the end, was more of a let down given they had no more sinister reason than making a public statement basically in an extreme fashion. Again, it was a pleasant read, but would not be on my list of top 20 for the year.",Pleasantly Ordinary
2886,"This book is what I'd call a woman's brand-name-dropping, combination bodice-ripper mystery/thriller. Rather short on the mystery /thriller part.Beautiful, successful young woman (BSYW) with a fiance who wears Amani suits and Burbury coats and picks her up in a stretch limo returns to her hometown to care for an ailing parent and solve anold mystery. (stop me if you've heard this one.)BSYW stays at a B&B; decorated in Laura Ashley and Ralph Lauren and meets her new BFF. Of course there is the obligatory,  handsome, rude, mysterious , brooding stranger. We know where this is going.The assorted characters sit around in their brand-name, designer clothes, on brand-name furniture sipping their brand-name vintage wines from Baccarat glasses. There is the usual sophisticated picnic with french bread, cheese and a vintage brand-name wine. Just once I'd like someone to show up for a picnic with peanut-butter sandwiches and a thermos of koolaid.The book did have two surprises for me. I expected  the cat to end up hanging in the closet or gutted out on the front step.  And I thought the fraternal twin sister would turn out to be a Russian orphan raised by the saintly murdered mother so you could say the book was full of two surprises for me.If you get the book free, or pay $2.99 as I did, you will probably get your money's worth.",Combination bodice-ripper and mystery/thriller

For that reason, even though the level of violence was much too much for me, someone else who was looking for this type of story may like it. I had to give only one star because of my tastes.

2892,"I like David and Jeremy from the earlier books in the series, namely Hidden Force and A Helping Hand. I am glad the abused David gets his HEA and there could not be a better choice than Jeremy to help this tormented man to heal. But close to 58% of the story is sex which is just too much for me. How do I count this. If you read it using Kindle it is easy especially when the first sex scene stops at 33% of the book. So while the sex is well written it is just too much. And why does a guy has to finally top or bottom, when he is reluctant initially, just to prove he is finally ready to take the plunge in a gay relationship. I like the plot, which is like an extension of the story in Hidden Force, and the guys. But this one just has too much sex even if well written.Hidden Force is still the best in the series.",I like the 2 guys here but just too much sex.

2894,"Keith and Abigail are an interesting leading couple. Both are alpha's (this is not typical for many paranormal/werewolf/vampire type books I've read) and strong. A leading lady that is strong but not hard and sarcastic is a welcome change for me. At first I thought Abby very smart - then she makes a choice I did not feel was in character for her and her strength sort of fizzles.I felt that the concept of a guide was good - that a new werewolf needed someone to help him/her control the wolf and learn about the community. Surprisingly that part did not seem rushed to me - I was fine with it. I thought the sex scenes were fine - they don't overwhelm the story nor do they seem contrived just for their own sake.What this book needed is about another 50-100 pages. Its true you hit the ground running but it leaves you with a quizzical bewildered viewpoint that just never really goes away. Too many unanswered questions.It needed backstory as to why the bad guy would turn Abigail, what he stood to gain from it, and why he so desperately seems to want her back. And her own backstory is flimsy - you just don't really feel her at all.Although there is some explanation of the politics of the shifter world it needed to be more in depth - as we are told repeatedly that there are bad alpha's and good alpha's and the good are becoming more and more scarce. I was very intruiged with that storyline and wanted a lot more depth and explanation of it - especially as the Main alpha Gavin didn't seem to have a ton of contact with other ""old school"" alpha's. It seems as if the story is going to devolve into an us vs. them...if so we need to be more connected to the ""us"" so we want to win against the ""them"".The werewolf/witch war also needed a bit of backstory - again another intriguing concept that gets barely a scarce mention and a very brief exposition. It would have been a much stronger book if we would have experienced Keith in combat - as it is we are just told.And that was my main problem with the novel - we are just told too much. It definitely had the feel of a series set up - the elements are all here they just don't fit into the puzzle as nicely as they could have. It has a very superficial feel. Like you are scratching the surface only and there is much below. It needed more fleshing out.However it is a quick read (very quick - all told less than an hour for me) and the characters are likable enough. It has great potential to develop into a wonderful series with more depth. I will be picking the other books up to read on my Kindle.",A pretty solid 1st in the series with a few issues
2895,"This is Jules Verne's attempt at writing a Robinson Crusoe / Swiss Family Robinson castaway story, with the twist that the five castaways crash-land a balloon and thus come to the island with almost nothing -- unlike Crusoe or the Swiss Family, the castaways here don't have a boat-full of resources, tools, etc., to fall back on, and have to make *everything* themselves, from the ground up, armed only with their knowledge of science and engineering. Since it always seemed to me that Crusoe and the Swiss Family cheated a bit by bringing so many tools and so forth along with themselves, I really enjoyed the more scientific focus, and this has now replaced Swiss Family as my answer to the ""what one book would you want with you on a desert island?"" question.Parts of the novel drag a bit, but it's a Jules Verne novel so there's a good story here -- the Island has a mysterious unseen inhabitant, also, there are pirates, which is always awesome.The main flaw is that this is based on the 1875 Kingston translation, which makes a fair number of edits on Verne's original -- for example, it changes some of the protagonists's names and removes some of Captain Nemo's anti-imperialist, anti-british rhetoric. There's a more accurate translation available for free in the Kindle store, so I'd recommend grabbing the accurate version instead (look for the edition where the engineer is named Cyrus Smith, rather than Cyrus Harding;  Kingston reportedly felt ""Smith"" was a ""gypsy name"" and hence unsuitable for a heroic character. You can find that version in the kindle store here:The Mysterious Island)Oh, yeah, Captain Nemo. This book is in some ways a sequel to Verne's _Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas_, as well as to his _In Search of the Castaways_. The sequence isn't direct -- really more a case of cameo characters than a direct plot sequel to either book -- but you might want to read those two books first before picking this one up.",Verne's version of Robinson Crusoe
2896,I love dragons and this story is one of the better ones with a whole different approach. It's full of what seem like original ideas to me.I'm so glad that the author didn't fall into the cliffhanger trap that so many apply to their series of books. This is a lovely story that stands alone but gives you enough enticement to go one to read the rest of the series.Nice easy to read writing style and good characterization - Well done Jenna.,Charming
2897,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence, no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But, while some of the formatting flaws add to the story, there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything.",Flawed but Beautifully Written

2900,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBianca D'Arc takes readers into an alternate world where dragons exist. In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora. Despite my initial hesitation about this series, I think I enjoy the world enough to read more about it!*ARC provided by publisher",deliciously intricate
2901,"This book was not my cup of tea.  I stopped reading at about page 50.  I found it very slow-moving with too much emphasis on minute details that weren't necessary for plot or character building.

The hero, Warwick, is an enforcer with only vengeance keeping him going.The author set the two characters up well and the romance between them was well written.

2905,"Apparently this is a prequel to the series.  I have read nothing of the series but bought the ""Lords of the Underworld"" bundle that has this book and the first three books.  I read a reviewer's note that said if you get the sample of this bundle that you will get the entire short story/prequel in that sample (word to the wise).  Of course that would only be helpful for people who have read the rest of the series and didn't want to buy the prequel.  For me, I just decided to delve into this series so I didn't mind getting it in the bundle.It has some pretty low reviews.  Normally I would never buy and probably wouldn't read a book or novella that has 3 stars.  I am pretty surprised it has such low reviews, but perhaps people were hoping for more from this prequel.This story is about the guardian to the gates of Hell (Geryon) and the goddess of oppression, Kadence who is in charging of maintaining the wall between the human realm and Hell.  The wall has a crack in it and Kadence bargains with Lucifer to allow Geryon to help her repair it.  Only the very end does it bring up Pandora's box (from what I can gather, the point of the story was to give us the background on Pandora's box, but I am not sure if Geryon or Kadence play any role in the rest of the books).I plan to read the next book, The Darkest Night next.

2913,"I had a little trouble getting into this book. I usually prefer historical romance to futuristic stories, but I was kind of drawn in by the concept of genetic engineering of classes of people. In this world, there are normal women called fems, normal men called mems, submissive females called obedients and super warrior males called primales. The primale Theron is called upon by the High Council to guard the fem Nyssa from threats of death. Against both of their wills they are drawn to each other, but primales never mate with fems, only obedients. The only way Theron can keep Nyssa under his watch is by physically dominating her. She says she hates it, but secretly she loves it.There is a lot of very graphic sex and BDSM scenes in this book, more so than plot. I think that if all the sex scenes were gone, the book would be half as long as it is now. What there is of a plot isn't bad, and the writer tries to show the difference in thinking between men (more than men) and women in dealing with conflict.Heat factor hot.",Futuristic dominance and submission

It's more fantasy-based with a world that I found intriguing.Emily wakes up in Steamside, a world connected to 1890's ""normal"" New York. Steamside's inhabitants are refugees like Emily who long to return to their times. Why are they here? It's not clearly explained, and that's not a good thing, which is a shame because Steamside is interesting.Rather, the setting is used more as a backdrop to a juvenile, nonsensical romance between the two leads. POVs were difficult to distinguish, and the dialogue was all jumbled up. The romance was tedious and unbelievable.

But all that would have been fine (I did get this book for free) if the rest of the story in particular, the hero's best friend, hadn't been portrayed so stereotypically. I mean seriously not every gay guy worries about how they look 24/7 even when their BEST FRIEND is about to be attacked by a group of hunters. This character was incredibly offensive in my opinion to the gay community and for that alone I would not recommend this book.",Ridiculous Love and Offensive
2937,"Fairy Tales from the German Forests includes ten tales of German origins. I'm fairy certain that these stories are only written to seem like fairy tales, instead of being properly traditional tales ala The Brother's Grimm.Because they are stories rather than folklore, the morals are heavy-handed, the prose is overfull of descriptions, the ethnocentrism is more distinct, and the setting is a bit more modern.Most of this can be explained because the intended audience is children, but with the unexpected use of a swastika (it's totally just crossed axes, though, according to the text), and the period-appropriate but not currently-appropriate gender roles for little girls, I can't recommend you read it to children. And with the annoying descriptions I can't recommend you read it as an adult. Although I did vaguely enjoy skimming one or two of the tales.But basically you should go find something more productive to read with your time. Or just...stare at a wall for a bit and imagine what an awesome fairy tale would be, because it'll almost definitely be better than these.There's a clickable table of contents and a few illustrations (remarkable!)Contains the following stories:What's the Use of It?The Engineer and the DwarfsKathchen and the KoboldThe Old KingThe Dragon's TailThe Easter HareThe Nixy LakeKing ReinholdThe Witch's GranddaughterHoliday Adventures",Unimpressive

Not only have his employers pressed charges against him for trying to steel their bull but he has also managed to become indebted to some rather unsavory characters.  So she does the only thing that she can think of she goes to his employers for help.  She wants them to stop pressing charges against him.  But, Shayne and Jackson take one look at the cute unsuspecting woman and decide that they won't drop the charges unless she agrees to be their housekeeper for at least a year.  Both hope for more, in the terms of a relationship, but are willing to start with the housekeeping.  They also both promise to keep her safe from the thugs that are pursuing her and her brother.Samantha can't believe that these two seriously good looking men are being so kind to her and her brother.  She is also a little surprised at how protective they have gotten of her.  She is attracted to both of them and can't seem to reconcile the feelings.  First there is good looking Jackson and then there is the gentle giant Shayne.  Will she be able to accept the future that Jackson is offering?  And will she and her brother Pete live to be able to live out their future?I found Dakota Ranch Crude to be an intriguing story.  I enjoy Ms. Brooke's style of writing and have found this recent Dakota Heat offering to be well written and spicy.  It is interesting that she has the story progress through the stages of the men being protective and not just lusting after Samantha.  I enjoyed Dakota Ranch Crude and look forward to other stories offered in the Dakota Heat Series.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Dakota Ranch Crude

But the stalker is still out there, and getting closer, and now Adrian wants to Mate her, is she strong enough to keep them both safe?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 1982 kindle locations, 20,000 words (short novella), but finishes around 1704 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent, *happy*.- ""Cat of a Different Color"" picks up as Book 1 ends. Sheri was introduced in passing as the discoverer of Becky's issues. Adrian has made cameos as Max's optometrist partner.- Sheri has ""type one albinism"" - she's legally blind (20/200), sensitive to light, and has a seeing-eye dog, Jerry.

She ""got out"" before it became too bad, but he has since stalked her. Sheri is a smart and intelligent woman who made some bad choices that haunted her future.- As a ""series"", the first three books should really be seen as a trilogy where the stories support each other.

2944,"I feel the need to start off by saying that I like good erotica.  This wasn't a book that I couldn't put down.  It wasn't one that I rooted either way for the characters to bang all day and in any location.  But, I didn't hate it either.  I think the book was priced appropriately at $1.19, given the length of the story and that it's an e-book.The author tried to make a story line that was different and I appreciate that and applaud her for being creative in that regard.  The sex scenes didn't set me on fire though.  The problem is my mind kept wandering.  I was trying to figure out their ages, how the contest even started, etc.  Perhaps I missed that information when I read the book.I'd say since it's only $1.19, go and buy it because it may be your cup of tea.  It just wasn't mine.I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.",not my cup of tea
2945,"Please don't let the reviewers who enjoy picking apart books sway you.  Often times what one person hates another loves.  Quite possibly you'll find you like this book.I didn't read the description of the book, nor the reviews before downloading it.  Sometimes I like going into a story blind because life is like that.  You never know where the road will lead.For my part, I only found a few things that threw me for loop.  The first one was when Alex, who'd been raised by her father her whole life, discovers her dad is a werewolf.  This is after we discover she believed there was no such thing as paranormal beings in the world.  One would think Alex would have struggled a tad more with the shocking news that werewolf's were real and guess what honey.  You're a half-breed.  Isn't that great?I would have gasped, stuttered and probably fainted, but within seconds of discovering this fact, Alex more or less shrugs her shoulders and goes on as though her belief hadn't just taken a turn into the bizarre.The second thing I struggled with was the fact that since Alex was `in heat'--as she was now maturing as a female werewolf--every time she looked at Joshua Striker, the hero, moisture was pooling you know where.  They had to watch out for werewolf's finding them because they, the mutts, could `smell her'.  I have to be honest and say, as often as Alex was having moisture pooling, I'd of smelt her too and I'm not a werewolf.  At least, I don't think I am.)Now that the negative is out of the way, and that's only my opinion, once I got past the above I found this book to be an enjoyable read.  It is an action packed adventure that had me turning the pages as quickly as I could.  N. J. Walters doesn't waste time going on and on with four or more pages of description.  The story moves along quickly.The bottom line, in my opinion:  If you like werewolf romance, don't mind some erotica and want a quick read, this book is for you.  The things I didn't like about the book aren't going to stop me from reading more from N. J. Walters, and will definitely be reading the second story in the series, ""Isaiah's Haven""!",Page turner-if you like erotica wordage

There's a lot of sadness in Phoebe's life, and it doesn't look to get much better until a stranger offers his friendship. The characters are much like I would imagine they would be in the time period in which the story is set. I had to remind myself a few times that this story was written when women had few rights and were at the mercy of the men in their lives, as well as their surroundings. It was extremely rare for a woman to be able to live a self-supporting, independent life in those days, and I would imagine many had few or no close friends. This book made me want to reach into the story and clobber the bad guy, rescue the girl, and chastise the ignorant family members.

Adding to this was the sometimes wordy style of the author and the silly actions by the players in the story.In total, the story was funny (with some bits where I outright laughed or chuckled) but felt contrived and too long.",Lots of Characters; Somewhat Silly; OK Read

2989,"I first read this book about 50 years ago, and I enjoyed it as much now as I did then. I couldn't have realized at that time, that I was  reading a precursor to MacGyver, Lost, Lassie, and countless other books, movies and TV shows. Jules Verne was a genius, and his writing style was absolutely delightful. Unfortunately a book worded thus today would realize only the sale of about ten copies. (I tried to imitate his style. It didn't work.)",Earned the right to be considered a classic.
2990,"Here I am again, reviewing another of Lanyon's novella-length stories and once again, I can't express strongly enough my appreciation for his technical skill, his intelligence and wit with a plot and characters, and his ability to draw me into the world with strong, believable happenstance. And in The Dickens With Love, Lanyon shines especially bright for adding a surprising amount of depth and backstory to the lead character, James Winter. Novella's are often hampered by their very nature, but in this, Lanyon rose above those limitations to provide an exceptionally well rounded character. His romantic lead, a Mr. Sedgwick Crisparkle, was perhaps NOT so fully defined and fleshed out, but was still superior to many two dimensional characters in novella-length stories.Add in a sweet holiday melancholy and yearnings for respectability once had and now lost and a measure of growth for James' character, and this lovely tale just shines like one of those starburst or starlight drinks Sedge favors so much. Which sounded delicious by the way...if a bit monsterously strong. The ""excerpts"" from the ""Christmas Cake"" were charming little surprises that lent an air of reality to the story as well. As I've said in a previous review of a novella-length Lanyon story, the only critique I truly have is that the romantic aspects of this m/m holiday romance don't quite touch me on as deep an emotional level as I'd hoped, but I still believe that's more due to the limiting nature of the length of the story than any failure on Lanyon's part. I admit...I'm cynical and don't believe in love developing within days or hours, so when the story spans such a time, it's hard for me to buy into a love-at-first-Dickens whirlwind romance.But top-notch storytelling, as always, for Lanyon.",My Fondness of Lanyon is Becoming Die-Hard
2991,i would prefer to have images and ads.  but for the price difference it is a no brainer.  going to cancel print subscription.  save trees.  give the nation difference as a donation.,excellent for kindle
2992,"This is not one of her better books. It was hard to get into the story, and it was hard to maintain an interest. This author has written much better books.",Don't waste your money
2993,"When the words ""sadomasochism and bondage"" appeared not far into this book, I was worried. A little bondage, a little swatting - okay - but this book had the darker stuff written all over it. Quite honestly, I almost put it down, but I decided to push ahead for two reasons...1. I knew at any time I could stop reading, delete it from my Kindle, and never think of it again.2. I have yet to read a bad Mari Carr book.Rough Cut is darker, but Ty's love for Gwen is very apparent. Even though he's controlling things in the bedroom, she holds the power. Gwen's struggle to accept her darker desires is handled quite perfectly. I thought Ty was considerate of her throughout the story and never once did I think he crossed a line. Rough Cut is a novella, but it takes place over the course of a few months plus a fabulous epilogue! For me, this will be a one-time read because there wasn't much else to it.",Good
2994,"I don't normally read short stories/novellas as I find that it is very rare to find one that gets deep enough into the plot to make it interesting but concise enough that the story is completed by the end. This book would encourage me to try out more!Graison has weaved a magical family christmas holiday fun fest for the reader, in which we learn why you should never tell a white lie to your mother! Bringing a boyfriend home for a family christmas would cause nerves, imagine bringing a fake one home! I enjoyed the banter that was passed back and forth between the family and you felt like you were there watching it all unfold before your eyes.",when a white lie spirals...
2995,This was kind of off. Didn't quite end the right way. something was lacking in the character department. This was odd on so many levels.there was some points in this book that was pretty good but overall it really comld have been a lot better.,odd ending
2996,"The stories are pretty good - not super scary, but not too simplistic, either.  My 8 year-old & I really enjoyed reading them together.",Pretty good stories
2997,Disappointed it was not her life story. I have to buy another book to read the rest of her life. I don t know if I will buy another.,Can you hear me now
2998,"IF YOU READ KILLING LINCOLN,you will enjoy this book.  Written in the first person by the first doctor to reach the President.  Poignant, personal,  excellently framed and paced.  Good read!!!",Outstanding Book by the Doctor
2999,but when you fall for the one you wish to destroy what do you do? I can say Meli has the greatest way to bring her old love to his knees because when you areused to getting what you want you find it hard to lose the woman you fell for... :) I love Ilona Andrews' writing in everything they write :),revenge is best served cold
