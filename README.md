# Sentiment Analysis on Kindle Book Review
In this project, machine learning methods are used to conduct sentiment analysis for a dataset which contains Amazon customer reviews on Kindle Book 
http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. The goal of this project is to turn text feature engineering into a supervised Deep Learning
(DL) task by using an appropriately designed DL model.

## General Information
The sentiment in the Amazon book reviews essentially dictates the customer's purchasing decision. In particular, a Kindle E-Book’s reputation mainly rests on 
a book rating on a scale of 1 to 5 which is an average of all the readers’ ratings. However, the rating itself is arbitrary and subject to personal
scaling preference: for instance, some refer to a “good” read as a 4 while others as a 5. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to scrutinise the 
review text and identify the reviews that provided a relatively more “objective” rating.

## Dataset description
The text dataset contains Amazon Kindle Book Review. In the dataset, each row represents a customer written 
review and summary along with their rating (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) on an entity.

## Methods Used
- Inferential Statistics
- Neural Network
- Deep Learning
- Predictive Modeling

## Algorithme
- Long short-term memory (LSTM)
